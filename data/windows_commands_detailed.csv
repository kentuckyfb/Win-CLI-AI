Options

   source  The location of the Windows directory to use as the source for
           copying boot-environment files.

   /l      The locale to use when initialising the BCD store. default = US English.

   /s      Optional. Specifies the volume letter of the system partition.
           This option should not be used in typical deployment scenarios.
           Use this setting to specify a system partition when you are configuring a drive that will
           be booted on another computer, such as a USB flash drive or a secondary hard drive.
           The default is the system partition identified by the firmware.

   /v      Enable verbose mode.

   /vbcd   Enable BCD Logging.

   /m      If an OS_Loader_GUID is specified, merge the given loader object within
           the system template to produce a bootable entry.
           Otherwise, by default, merge only global objects.

   /d      Preserve the existing default Windows Boot entry.

   /f      Used with /S, specifies the firmware type of the target system partition
           Options for firmware are 'UEFI', 'BIOS', or 'ALL'

           If you specify 'ALL', BCDBoot will create both the \Boot and the \Efi\Microsoft\Boot
           directories, and will copy all required boot-environment files for BIOS and UEFI.

  /addlast  Specifies that the Windows Boot Manager firmware entry should be added last.
           The default behavior is to add it first. Cannot be used with /p.

  /bcdclean Clean the BCD Store. By default, simply removes any duplicate entries in
           the BCD. Can be followed by 'full'. In this case, each entry is scanned
           If the corresponding device for that entry does not exist, the entry is deleted.

   /p      Specifies that the existing Windows Boot Manager firmware entry position should be
           preserved in the UEFI boot order. If the entry does not exist, a new entry is
           added in the first position. Cannot be used with /addlast.

           By default, during an upgrade BCDBoot moves the Windows Boot Manager to be
           the first entry in the UEFI boot order.

Key
      /? command   To display detailed help for a particular command, run bcdedit /? command,
                    where command is the name of the command you are searching for more information about.
                    e.g. bcdedit /? createstore

   Store commands:

      /createstore  Creates a new empty boot configuration data store.
                    The created store is not a system store.

      /export       Export the contents of the system store into a file.
                    This file can be used later to restore the state of the system store.
                    Valid only for the system store.

      /import       Restore the state of the system store by using a backup data file
                    previously generated with /export.
                    This command deletes any existing entries in the system store before
                    the import takes place. Valid only for the system store.

      /store        This option can be used with most BCDedit commands to specify
                    the store to be used. If this option is not specified, then
                    BCDEdit operates on the system store.
                    Running the bcdedit /store command by itself is equivalent to running
                    the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /sysstore     Set the system store device. This only affects EFI-based systems.
                    It does not persist across reboots, and is only used in cases where the system
                    store device is ambiguous.

   Operating on entries in a store:

      /copy         Make a copy of a specified boot entry in the same system store.

      /create       Create a new entry in the boot configuration data store.
                    If a well-known identifier is specified, then the /application, /inherit, and
                    /device options cannot be specified. If an identifier is not specified or not well
                    known, an /application, /inherit, or /device option must be specified. 

      /delete       Delete an element from a specified entry.

      /mirror       Create a mirror of entries in the store.

   Changing entry options:

      /deletevalue  Delete a specified element from a boot entry.

      /set          Set an entry option value.

   List current settings:

      /enum [type | id] [/v]
                    List entries in a store.
                    Types: ACTIVE, FIRMWARE, BOOTAPP, BOOTMGR, OSLOADER, RESUME, INHERIT, ALL
                    The /enum option is the default value for BCEdit, so running
                    the bcdedit command without options is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /v            Verbose mode.
                    Usually, any well-known entry identifiers are represented by their friendly shorthand form.
                    Specifying /v as a command-line option displays all identifiers in full.
                    Running the bcdedit /v command by itself is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active /v command.

   Controlling the boot manager:

      /bootsequence Specifies a one-time display order to be used for the next boot.
                    This command is similar to the /displayorder option, except that it is used only the
                    next time the computer starts. Afterwards, the computer reverts to the original
                    display order.
      /default      Specifies the default entry that the boot manager selects when the timeout expires.

      /displayorder Specifies the display order that the boot manager uses when displaying boot options
                    to a user.
      /timeout      Specifies the time to wait, in seconds, before the boot manager selects the default entry.

      /toolsdisplayorder  Specifies the display order for the boot manager to use when displaying the Tools menu.

   Emergency Management Services options:

      /bootems      Enable or disable Emergency Management Services (EMS) for the specified entry.

      /ems          Enable or disable EMS for the specified Operating System boot entry.

      /emssettings  Set the global EMS settings for the computer.
                    /emssettings does not enable or disable EMS for any particular boot entry.

   Debugging:

      /bootdebug    Enable or disable the boot debugger for a specified boot entry.
                    Although this command works for any boot entry, it is effective only for boot applications.

      /dbgsettings  Specifies or displays the global debugger settings for the system.
                    This command does not enable or disable the kernel debugger; use the /debug option for
                    that purpose. To set an individual global debugger setting, use the
                    bcdedit /setdbgsettings type value command.

      /debug        Enable or disable the kernel debugger for a specified boot entry.

      /hypervisorsettings  Set the hypervisor parameters.

      instructs BITS to read 100 bytes starting at offset zero, 100 bytes starting
      at offset 2000, and the remainder of the URL starting at offset 5000.

   /REPLACEREMOTEPREFIX job old_prefix new_prefix
       All files whose URL begins with old_prefix are changed to use new_prefix

Certutil isn't recommended to be used in any production code and doesn't provide any guarantees of live site support or application compatibilities. It's a tool utilized by developers and IT administrators to view certificate content information on devices. Certutil.exe is a command-line program installed as part of Certificate Services. You can use certutil.exe to display certification authority (CA) configuration information, configure Certificate Services, and back up and restore CA components. The program also verifies certificates, key pairs, and certificate chains. If certutil is run on a certification authority without other parameters, it displays the current certification authority configuration.

   /cvtarea:FileName
            Specifies that the Master File Table (MFT) and other NTFS metadata
            files are written to an existing, contiguous placeholder file.

            This file must be in the root directory of the file system to be converted.
            Use of the /cvtarea parameter can result in a less fragmented file system 
            after conversion.
            For best results, the size of this file should be 1 KB multiplied by the number of files
            and directories in the file system, although the convert utility accepts files of any size.

              Display all the shares in the local cache.
              With the /RECURSE option, this will display the contents
              of the shares within a parent share.

   /DISCONNECT:\\Server
   /DISCONNECT:\\Server\Share 
              Disconnect a server or share from CSC on this client. 

   /MOVESHARE:\\Server1\Share \\Server2\Share 
              Move files and folders from one share to another in the cache.
              This is useful if the local cache must point to a new/renamed server location.

   /RESID     Restamp all the entries in the Windows offline files (CSC) database

   /PIN2:\\server\share\path [/USER] [/SYSTEM] [/USERINHERIT] [/SYSTEMINHERIT]
              Pin shared resources:
              Use the PIN2: /USER option to pin a file. This has the same result
              as using the Offline Files dialog box to cache the file.
              Use PIN2: /SYSTEM to specify that the share will be pinned via Group Policy.
              /USERINHERIT and /SYSTEMINHERIT] will determine how the pin data is inherited.

   /PIN2:filename /FILELIST [/UNICODE] [/USER] [/SYSTEM] [/USERINHERIT] [/SYSTEMINHERIT] 
              Use a file to describe the objects to pin
              The file contains the UNC path of each object to pin.
              /FILELIST = the objects are separated by a carriage return/linefeed.

   /UNPIN2:\\server\share\path [/USER] [/SYSTEM] [/USERINHERIT] [/SYSTEMINHERIT] [/RECURSE] 
              UnPin a shared resource or remove a shared resource from the local cache.
              with /RECURSE, CSCCMD will unpin all children of the path.
              with /RECURSE2, CSCCMD will unpin the path and children of the path.

   /UNPIN2:filename /FILELIST [/UNICODE] [/USER] [/SYSTEM] [/USERINHERIT] [/SYSTEMINHERIT]
              UnPin specific shared resources listed in filename.

              Delete a file, a directory, or a share from the local cache.
              Ensure that the directory/share is empty before you use this switch.
              with /RECURSE, CSCCMD tool only operates on the children of the path.
              with /RECURSE2, CSCCMD operates on the path and children of the path.

   /IsSERVEROFFLINE:\\Server 
              Does CSC consider \\server to be offline.
              To get a reliable response from this switch, you must first open a
              share/file/directory from the local cache for \\server  

   /SETSPACE:Bytes  
              Specify the disk space in bytes to allocate to temporary offline files.
              These files are nonpinned, auto-cached files.
              This is similar to the function provided in the Offline Files dialog box.

   /CHECKDB [/QUICK] 
              Examine the CSC database and display any database error flags.
              /QUICK will skip the enumeration and just display database errors.

   /EXTRACT[:\\Server\Share[\Path]] /TARGET:Path [/RECURSE] [/ONLYMODIFIED] [/STOPONERROR]

Popd",[],"Very old versions of Windows (Windows 95 and earlier) had the DELTREE command to delete all sub-folders and files. Newer versions of Windows do not have this command, but we can easily write a short batch script to do the same thing. Deleting from the command line is significantly faster than using Windows Explorer, often seconds instead of minutes,  there is no running calculation of file sizes and no recycle bin. This does mean there is no possibility of an undo other than restoring a backup. In many cases, simply running RD from the command line will be orders of magnitude faster than using Windows Explorer. However for very large deletes (roughly 100,000 files plus) an additional significant time saving can be achieved by using a two pass approach: first deleting the files and then the folders. The two key commands required are DEL /s to delete all files including hidden and system files, followed by 
RD /s to remove the now empty folders. WARNING: if you have  any directory junctions DEL will delete the destination directory and not the junction. Be very careful not to run these commands unless you know there are no junctions inside the target directory. “However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results” ~ Sir Winston Churchill RD - Delete folders or entire folder trees.

Key
   /s scriptname.txt (one command per line)
         To create a diskpart script, create a text file scriptname.txt containing the Diskpart commands that you 
         want to run, one command per line, and no empty lines. Start a line with REM to make the line a comment.

Commands you can issue at the DISKPART prompt or in a text file:

 ACTIVE  On basic disks, mark the partition with focus as active.

         DiskPart does not check the contents of the partition. If you mistakenly mark a partition as active
         and it does not contain the Operating System startup files, your computer might not start.
         This informs the basic input/output system (BIOS) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) that
         the partition or volume is a valid system partition or system volume.
         Only partitions can be marked as active. A partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.
         Use the select partition command to select a partition and shift the focus to it.

 ADD disk=n [align=n] [wait] [noerr]
         Mirror the simple volume with focus to the specified disk.

 ASSIGN  [{LETTER=D  | mount=path}] [noerr]
         Assign a drive letter or mount point to the volume with focus. (Only Server 2012-2022)

         If no drive letter or mount point is specified, the next available drive letter is assigned.
         By using the assign command, you can change the drive letter associated with a removable drive.
         You cannot assign drive letters to system volumes, boot volumes, or volumes that contain the paging file.
         In addition, you cannot assign a drive letter to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partition
         or any GUID Partition Table (gpt) partition other than a basic data partition.
         A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.
         Use the select volume command to select a volume and shift the focus to it.
         ## Example To assign the letter E to the volume in focus, type: assign letter=e

 ATTRIBUTES DISK [{set | clear}] [readonly] [noerr] ATTRIBUTES VOLUME [{set | clear}] [{hidden | readonly | nodefaultdriveletter | shadowcopy}] [noerr]
         Display, set, or clear the attributes of a disk or volume.

         Enable or disable the automount feature.

 BREAK disk=n [nokeep] [noerr]
         Break the mirrored volume with focus into two simple volumes.

 CLEAN [all]       (Server 2012-2022)
         Remove any and all partition or volume formatting from the disk with focus, 'all' will Zero the disk.
         See also the PowerShell cmdlet clear-disk

 COMPACT vdisk       (Windows Server 2008R2-2022)
         Reduce the physical size of a dynamically expanding virtual hard disk (VHD) file.
         This parameter is useful because dynamically expanding VHDs increase in size as you add files, but they do
         not automatically reduce in size when you delete files.

 CONVERT Convert file allocation table (FAT) and FAT32 volumes to the NTFS file system. 

 CREATE partition efi [size=n] [offset=n] [noerr]

                      [maximum=n] [sd=SDDL] [noerr]
         Create a virtual disk (VHD).

 DELETE disk [noerr] [override]
 DELETE partition [noerr] [override]
 DELETE volume [noerr]
         Delete a partition, volume or a dynamic disk from the list of disks.

         Format a disk for use with Windows.

 GPT attributes=n     (Windows Server 2012-2022)  OEM use only.
      On basic GUID partition table (gpt) disks, this command assigns the gpt attribute(s) to the partition with focus.
      Gpt partition attributes give additional information about the use of the partition.
      Some attributes are specific to the partition type GUID.
      This might cause your basic data volumes to fail to be assigned drive letters, or to prevent the file system from mounting.

 MERGE vdisk depth=n           (Windows Server 2008R2-2022)
         Merge a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD) with its corresponding parent VHD.
         depth=1 will merge with parent.
         The parent VHD will be modified to include the modifications from the differencing VHD.
         As a result, other differencing VHDs that are dependent on the parent will no longer be valid.
         You must choose and detach a VHD for this operation to succeed.
         Use the 'select vdisk' command to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.

      DISM.exe /Remount-Wim /MountDir:C:\test\offline 

   Delete resources associated with a corrupted mounted image:
   /Cleanup-Wim 

   This command does not unmount a mounted image; it also does not delete 
   images that can be recovered by using the /Remount-WIM command. 

    Example: 
      DISM.exe /Cleanup-Wim 

   Apply an .ffu image to a specified physical drive:
   /Apply-Ffu /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /ApplyDrive:physical_drive_path 
  [/SFUFile:pattern] 


  Use /SFUFile to reference split FFU files (SFUs). pattern is the naming 
  pattern and location of split files. 

    Examples: 
      DISM.exe /Apply-Ffu /ImageFile:flash.ffu 
        /ApplyDrive:\\.\PhysicalDrive0 

   Capture a physical disk image to a new FFU file:
   /Capture-Ffu /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /CaptureDrive:physical_drive_path 
     /Name:Name [/Description:Description] [/PlatformIds:platform_ids] 
        [/Compress:{default|none}] 

     /PlatformIds  - One or more platform ids (separate with semicolon) to be add
                     to the image. If not specified, platform id will be '*'.

     /Compress     - The type of compression used for the initial capture operation. 

    Example: 
      DISM.exe /Capture-Ffu /ImageFile:install.ffu

        /PlatformIds:Qualcomm.MSM8994.P6211;Microsoft.MSM8994.P6211 
        /Compress:default 

    Optimize an FFU image to be faster to deploy, and more easily deployed to differently-sized disks.
   /Optimize-FFU /ImageFile:path-to-ffu-file [/PartitionNumber:PartitionNumber]

     /ImageFile     - Path to the FFU you want to optimize.
     /PartitionNumber - By default /Optimize-FFU optimizes the OS partition.
                        This option allows you to specify the partition that you want to optimize.

    This command should be the last command run against an image before the image is applied to a device,
    and can reduce time on the factory floor when building devices for build-to-stock scenarios.

     DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image {/Boot | /WimBoot}

     /Boot  Tries to reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            This optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed on the image
            after optimizing it.  DISM /Optimize-Image /boot is available in the following Operating Systems: Windows 11,
            Windows 10, version 1607,Windows 10, version 1809 and later, Windows Server 2012 R2 later

            Use /Boot to try and reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            Note that this optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed
            on the image after optimizing it.
     /WimBoot is for configuring an offline image for installing on a WIMBoot system.

    Examples: DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image /Boot
              DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image /WimBoot

    Applies one or more siloed provisioning packages (SPPs) to a specified image.
      This option is only available after running CopyDandI.cmd from the ADK, Version 1607 or later, and running
      dism.exe /Apply-SiloedPackage from the target folder created by CopyDandI.cmd.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage can only be run once against a Windows image, but /PackagePath can used more than once
      in the same command to apply multiple SPPs. SPPs will be applied in the specified order, so a dependency should
      be specified before the SPP that depends on it. see Siloed provisioning packages.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:package_path /ImagePath:applied_image_path

      /PackagePath - Specifies the path of a siloed provisioning package file.
      /ImagePath - Specifies the path of the Windows image where you are applying the SPP.
    Example: 
      DISM.exe /apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:C:\test\Word.spp /PackagePath:C:\test\spp2.spp /ImagePath:C:\

    Split an existing .ffu file into multiple read-only split FFU files. 
   /Split-Ffu /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /SFUFile:path_to_sfu
      /FileSize:MB-Size [/CheckIntegrity] 

     /FileSize - The maximum size in megabytes (MB) for each created file. 
                 If a single file is larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option, one of the
                 split .swm files that results will be larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option,
                 in order to accommodate the large file.

     /CheckIntegrity
                 Detect and track .wim file corruption when used with capture, unmount, export, and commit operations.
                 /CheckIntegrity stops the operation if DISM detects that the .wim file is corrupted when used
                 with apply and mount operations.

     /ImageFile  Specifies the path of a .FFU file, example: flash.ffu.
     /SFUFile    References split FFU files (SFUs). Pattern is the naming pattern and location of split files.

    Example: 
      DISM.exe /Split-Ffu /ImageFile:flash.ffu /SFUFile:flash.sfu /FileSize:650

FC,Compare two files,https://ss64.com/nt/fc.html,"Syntax
      FC [options] [drive1:][path1] filename1 [drive2:][path2] filename2

Options
   /A    Abbreviate the output of an ASCII comparison, display only first and last lines
         for each set of differences.

   /B    Perform a binary comparison. FC compares the two files byte by byte and does not attempt
         to resynchronize the files after finding a mismatch.
         This is the default mode for comparing files that have the following file extensions:
          .exe, .com, .sys, .obj, .lib, or .bin. 

   /C    Do a case insensitive string comparison

   /L    Compare the files in ASCII mode. Fc compares the two files line by line and attempts to resynchronize
         the files after finding a mismatch.
         This is the default mode for comparing non binary files, see /B. 

   /LBn  Set the n number of lines for the internal line buffer. The default length of the line buffer is 100 lines.
         If the files being compared have more than this number of consecutive differing lines, FC cancels the comparison. 

   /N    Display line numbers during an ASCII comparison.

   /T    Prevent FC from converting tabs to spaces.
         The default behavior is to treat tabs as spaces, with stops at each eighth character position.

   /U    Compares files as Unicode text files.

   /W    Compress white space (that is, tabs and spaces) during the comparison.
         If a line contains many consecutive spaces or tabs, /w treats these characters as a single space.
         When used with the /W command-line option, FC ignores (and does not compare) white space at the beginning and end of a line. 

   /nnnn   The a number of consecutive lines that must match before FC considers the files to be resynchronized.
           If the number of matching lines in the files is less than nnnn, FC displays the matching lines as differences.
           The default value is 2.

 [ drive1 : ][ path1 ] filename1   The location and name of the first file you want to compare.
                                   Filename1 is required.

 [ drive2 : ][ path2 ] filename2   The location and name of the second file you want to compare.
                                   Filename2 is required.

   volume          The drive letter (followed by a colon), mount point, or volume name.
                   that you want to format. If you don’t specify any of the following command-line
                   options, format uses the volume type to determine the default format for the disk.

   /FS:file-system The type of file system (FAT, FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, UDF, ReFS).
   /A:size         Override the default allocation unit size. Also known as Cluster size.
                   Default settings are strongly recommended for general use. See below for allocation unit sizes.
                   NTFS compression is not supported for allocation unit sizes above 4096.

   /C              Compression, files added to the new disk will be compressed by default (NTFS only).

   /D              UDF 2.50 only: Metadata will be duplicated.

   /DAX[:state]    NTFS Only: Enable direct access storage (DAX) mode for this volume.
                   In DAX mode, the volume is accessed via the memory bus, boosting IO performance.
                   A volume can be formatted with DAX mode only if the hardware is DAX capable. 
                   State can specify ""enable"" or ""disable"".   * Windows 10+
                   /DAX is considered as /DAX:enable.

   /F:size         The size of the floppy disk to format (720, 1.2, 1.44, 2.88, or 20.8).

   /I:state        ReFS only: enable integrity on the new volume.
                   ""state"" is either ""enable"" or ""disable""
                   Integrity is enabled on storage that supports data redundancy
                   by default.

   /L              NTFS Only: Use large file record segments (FRS).
                   By default, the volume will be formatted with small size file records.
                   Use this to host very large files, such as VDHX files larger than 1 TB.
                   This increases the number of extents allowed per file on the volume.

   /LogSize[:size] NTFS Only: The size for NTFS log file in kilobytes.
                   The minimum supported size is 2MB, so specifying size smaller than 2MB will
                   result in a 2MB log file.  Zero indicates the default value which generally
                   depend on the volume size.   * Windows 10+

                  last character of the source file name is replaced
                  with an underscore (_) and used as the destination.

   /F directives  A file containing directives for MAKECAB to use (may be repeated).
                  If more than one directive file is specified (/F file1 /F file2 ...), they
                  are processed in the order (left to right) specified on the command line.

                  Variable settings, open cabinets, open disks, etc. are all carried forward
                  from one directive file to the next (just as if all of the files had been
                  concatenated together and presented as a single file to MakeCAB).
                  For example, this is intended to simplify the work for a product shipped in
                  multiple languages. There would be a short, language-specific directives file, 
                  and then a single, master directives file that covers the bulk of the product.

   /D var=value   Defines variable with specified value. (may be repeated).
                  Equivalent to using .Set in a directives file.
                  For example, a single directive file could be used to produce layouts
                  for different disk sizes by running MakeCAB once with different values of
                  MaxDiskSize defined: /D MaxDiskSize=1.44M. Both standard MakeCAB variables
                  and custom variables can be defined in this way.

                  If .Option Explicit is specified in a directive file,
                  then variable must be defined with a .Define command in a directive file.
                  To use a variable substitution (as in the directive file with %)
                  use double %%

   /L dir         Folder location to place destination file (default is current directory).
                  most useful when destination is not specified.

NLTEST,Network Location Test (AD),https://ss64.com/nt/nltest.html,"Syntax
      NLTEST [/server:servername] [operation[parameter]

Key
   /server: ServerName 
            Run nltest at a remote domain controller: ServerName.
            default = the local computer (a domain controller).

   /query   Report on the state of the secure channel the last time you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)

   /repl    Force synchronization with the primary domain controller (PDC).
            Nltest synchronizes only changes that are not yet replicated to the backup
            domain controller (BDC). NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sync    Force an immediate synchronization with the PDC of the entire SAM database.
            NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /pdc_repl Force the PDC to send a synchronization notification to all BDCs.
            NT 4.0 PDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_query: DomainName
             Report on the state of the secure channel the last time that you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)
            This parameter lists the name of the domain controller that you queried on the
            secure channel, also.

   /sc_reset:[ DomainName]
            Remove, and then rebuild, the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_verify:[ DomainName]
            Check the status of the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            If the secure channel does not work, this parameter removes the existing channel, and
            then builds a new one. You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_change_pwd:[ DomainName]
            Change the password for the trust account of a domain that you specify.
            If you run nltest on a domain controller, and an explicit trust relationship exists,
            then nltest resets the password for the interdomain trust account.
            Otherwise, nltest changes the computer account password for the domain that you specify.

   /dclist:[ DomainName]
            List all DCs in the domain.
            This command first queries Active Directory for a list of DCs.
            If this query is unsuccessful, nltest then uses the Browser service (if netbios is enabled).

   /dcname:[ DomainName]
            List the primary domain controller or the PDC emulator for DomainName.

   /dsgetdc:[ DomainName]
            Query the Domain Name System (DNS) server for a list of DCs and their
            IP addresses. This parameter also contacts each domain controller to check for connectivity.
            The following list shows the values that you can use to filter the list of DCs
            or specify alternate names types in the syntax.

            /PDC: Return only the PDC (Windows NT 4.0) or domain controllers designated as the PDC
                  emulator (Windows 2000 and later).
            /DS:  Return only those DCs that are Windows 2000 and later.
            /DSP: Return only Windows 2000 and later DCs. If the query finds no such server,
                  then return Windows NT 4.0 DCs.
            /GC:  Return only those DCs that are designated as global catalog servers.
            /KDC: Return only those DCs that are designated as Kerberos key distribution centers.
            /TIMESERV: Return only those DCs that are designated as time servers.
            /GTTIMESERV: Return only DCs designated as master time servers.
            /WS: /NetBIOS: Specifies computer names in the syntax as NetBIOS names.
            /DNS: Specify computer names in the syntax as fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
                  If you do not specify a return format, the DC can return either NetBIOS or DNS format.
            /IP:  Return only DCs that have IP addresses. i.e. return only TCP/IP DCs.
            /FORCE: Force the computer to run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in
                    the cache for the information.
            /Writable: Require that the returned DC be writable; All Windows 2000 DCs are writable
            /Avoidself: When called from a DC, specifies that the returned DC name should
                        not be the current computer. If the current computer is not a DC, this flag is ignored.
                        This flag can be used to obtain the name of another DC in the domain.
            /LDAPOnly: Specifies that the server returned is an LDAP server. The server returned is not
                       necessarily a DC. This flag can be used with the DS_GC_SERVER_REQUIRED flag
                       to return an LDAP server that also hosts a global catalog server.

               /LDAPONLY: Return servers that are running a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) application.
                          The servers can include LDAP servers that are not DCs.
               /FORCE:    Run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in cache.
               /SITE Sitename: Sort to list first the records that pertain to Sitename.
               /SITESPEC:      Filter the returned records to display only Sitename, used only with /SITE.

   /dsgetfti: DomainName[ /UpdateTDO]
            Return information about interforest trusts. You use this parameter only for a Windows Server 2008
            domain controller that is in the root of the forest. If no interforest trusts exist, this parameter
            returns an error. The /UpdateTDO value updates the locally stored information on the interforest trust.

               /DOM:  Specify a DNS domain name for the host to use when you search for records on the DNS server.
                      If you do not specify this value, nltest uses the DNS domain name as the suffix of the
                      DnsHostName parameter.
               /DSAGUID: Deletes Directory System Agent (DSA) records that are based on a GUID.
               DOMGUID: Deletes DNS records that are based on a globally unique identifier (GUID).

   /whowill: Domain/ User
            Find the DC that has the user account that you specify. Use this parameter to determine
            whether nltest has replicated the account information to other DCs.

   /finduser: User
            Find the directly-trusted domain that the user account User belongs to.
            Use this parameter to troubleshoot logon issues of older client Operating Systems.

   /transport_notify    Flushe the negative cache to force the discovery of a domain controller.
                        You can use this parameter for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers only.
                        This operation is done automatically when clients log on to Windows 2000 and
                        Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.
   /dbflag: HexadecimalFlags
            Set a new debug flag. For most purposes, use 0x2000FFFF as the value for HexadecimalFlags.
            The entry in the Windows Server 2003 registry for debug flags is
            HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DBFlag.

   /user: UserName
            Display many of the attributes that you maintain in the SAM account database for the user that
            you specify. You cannot use this parameter for user accounts that are stored in an AD database.

   /time: HexadecimalLSL HexadecimalMSL
            Convert Windows NT Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time to ASCII. HexadecimalLSL is a hex value for
            least significant longword. HexadecimalMSL is a hexa value for most significant longword.

   /logon_query
            Query the cumulative number of NTLM logon attempts at a console or over a network.

   /domain_trusts
            Returns a list of trusted domains. /Primary /Forest /Direct_Out /Direct_In /All_Trusts /v.
            values that you can use to filter the list of domains:
               /Primary: Return only the domain to which the computer account belongs.
               /Forest: Return only those domains that are in the same forest as the primary domain.
               /Direct_Out: Return only the domains that are explicitly trusted with the primary domain.
               /Direct_In: Return only the domains that explicitly trust the primary domain.
               /All_Trusts: Return all trusted domains.
               /v: Display verbose output, including any domain SIDs and GUIDs that are available.

   /dsquerydns
            Query for the status of the last update for all DNS records that are specific to a DC.

   /bdc_query: DomainName
            Query for a list of BDCs in DomainName, and then display their state of synchronization
            and replication status. You can use this parameter only for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers.

   /sim_sync: DomainName ServerName
            Simulate full synchronization replication. This is a useful parameter for test environments.

   /list_deltas: FileName
            Display the contents of the FileName change log file, which lists changes to the user account 
            database. Netlogon.chg is the default name for this log file, which resides only on Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.

   /cdigest: Message /domain: DomainName
            Display the current digest that the client uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest that is based on the previous password, also. Nltest uses
            the secure channel for logons between client computers and a domain controller, or for
            directory service replication between domain controllers. You can use this parameter in
            conjunction with the /sdigest parameter to check the synchronization of trust account passwords.

   /sdigest: <Message> /rid: RID_In_Hexadecimal
            Display the current digest that the server uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest for the previous password, also. If the digest from the
            server matches the digest from the client, then nltest synchronizes the passwords that it
            uses for the secure channel. If the digests do not match, then nltest might not have replicated
            the password change yet.

   /shutdown: Reason [Seconds]
            Remotely shut down the server that you specify in ServerName.
            Use a string to specify the reason for the shutdown in the Reason value.
            Use an integer value of Seconds before the shutdown will occur.
            (see InitiateSystemShutdown in the Platform SDK documentation.)

         The name of the remote computer that manages the printer. 

   -p PrinterName 
         The name of the printer.

   -u UserName -w Password 
         An account with permission to connect WMI services to the computer
         that hosts the printer. e.g. A member of the Administrators group. 

   -r PortName 
         The port to which the printer is connected.
         If this is a parallel or a serial port, then use the ID of the port
         (for example, LPT1 or COM1). If this is a TCP/IP port, then use the
         port name that was specified when the port was added. 

   -l Location 
         The printer location, such as ""Copier Room."" 

   -m Comment 
         A comment string.

   -f SeparatorText 
         A file that contains the text that appears on the separator page. 

   -y DataType 
         Data types that the printer can accept. 

   -st StartTime 
         Specify a time of the day after which the printer is available.
         If you send a document to a printer when it is unavailable, the
         document is held (spooled) until the printer becomes available.
         Specify time as a 24-hour clock. e.g. 2300

   -ut EndTime 
         Specify a time of the day after which the printer is no longer available.

   -o Priority 
         A priority that the spooler uses to route print jobs.
         A print queue with a higher priority receives all its
         jobs before any queue with a lower priority. 

   -i DefaultPriority 
            The default priority assigned to each print job. 

   {+ | -}shared 
            Is this printer is shared on the network.

            Is the document to be sent directly to the printer without being spooled. 

   {+ | -}published 
            Is this printer to be published in Active Directory.
            If you publish a printer, other users can search for it based on its location
            and capabilities, such as color printing and stapling.

   {+ | -}hidden 
             Reserved function.

   {+ | -}rawonly 
             Are only raw data print jobs to be spooled on this queue. 

   {+ | -}queued 
             Do not begin to print until after the last page of the document is spooled.
             The printing program is unavailable until the document has finished printing.
             This option ensures that the whole document is available to the printer.

   {+ | -}keepprintedjobs 
             Retain documents after they are printed.
             Allows a user to resubmit a document to the printer from the print queue. 

   {+ | -}workoffline 
             Allow sending print jobs when computer is not connected to the network. 

   {+ | -}enabledevq 
             Print jobs that do not match the printer setup (for example, PostScript files
             spooled to non-PostScript printers) should be held in the queue rather than 
             being printed. 

   {+ | -}docompletefirst 
             Allocate jobs to a printer as soon as thay are spooled.
             If this option is disabled, the spooler always sends higher priority
             jobs to their respective queues first.
             You should enable this option if you want to maximize printer efficiency
             at the cost of job priority.  

   {+ | -}enablebidi 
             Send bi-directional status information to the spooler.

Key:

   -a   Avoid outage. Requires -r. If the trigger will cause the target to suspend for a 
        prolonged time due to an exceeded concurrent dump limit, the trigger will be skipped.

   -b   Treat debug breakpoints as exceptions (otherwise ignore them).

   -c   CPU threshold at which to create a dump of the process.

   -cl  CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process.

   -d   Invoke the minidump callback routine named MiniDumpCallbackRoutine of the specified DLL.

   -e   Write a dump when the process encounters an unhandled exception. Include the 1 to
        create dump on first chance exceptions.

   -f   Filter the first chance exceptions. Wildcards (*) are supported. To just display the
        names without dumping, use a blank ("""") filter.

   -g   Run as a native debugger in a managed process (no interop).

   -h   Write dump if process has a hung window (does not respond to window messages for at least 5 seconds).

   -i   Install ProcDump as the AeDebug postmortem debugger.
        Only -ma, -mp, -d and -r are supported as additional options.

   -l   Display the debug logging of the process.

   -m   Trigger a dump when memory commit reaches this threshold value (in MB).

   -ma  Write a dump file with all process memory. The default dump format only includes thread
        and handle information.

   -ml  Trigger when memory commit drops below specified threshold value (in MB).

   -mp  Write a dump file with thread and handle information, and all read/write process memory.
        To minimize dump size, memory areas larger than 512MB are searched for, and if found,
        the largest area is excluded. A memory area is the collection of same sized memory allocation
        areas. The removal of this (cache) memory reduces Exchange and SQL Server dumps by over 90%.

   -n   Number of dumps to write before exiting.

   -o   Overwrite an existing dump file.

   -p   Trigger on the specified performance counter when the threshold is exceeded.
        Note: to specify a process counter when there are multiple instances of the process running,
        use the process ID with the following syntax: ""\Process(name_pid)\counter""

   -pl  Trigger when performance counter falls below the specified value.

   -r   Dump using a clone. Concurrent limit is optional (default 1, max 5).
        CAUTION: a high concurrency value can impact system performance.
          Windows 8.0 : Uses Reflection. OS doesn’t support -e.
          Windows 8.1+: Uses PSS. All trigger types are supported.

   -s   Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10).

   -u   Treat CPU usage relative to a single core (used with -c).
        As the only option, Uninstalls ProcDump as the postmortem debugger.

   -w   Wait for the specified process to launch if it’s not running.

REM at the start of a line signifies a comment or REMARK. An alternative is adding :: at
the start of a line, this has a similar effect to REM. Double colons act like a GOTO or CALL :label the second colon is  invalid as a name  but is still treated as a label, and so the line is always skipped. @ECHO OFF
::
:: First comment
REM Second comment
REM
Echo Hello REM This remark is displayed by echo
Echo Hello & REM This remark is ignored by echo
Copy work.xls backup.xls &:: We backed up the file

Although you can use REM without a comment to add vertical spacing to a batch
file, you can also use completely blank lines. The blank lines are ignored when processing
the batch program. The double-colon :: is not documented as a comment command. An important limitation of this is that as a label it can only be used at the beginning of the line. Also because the double colon is a command, it will be displayed if you run a batch file without @ECHO OFF A REM comment is slightly slower to process than :: (360µs versus 58µs per comment line)
A REM comment is a documented command that may be used almost anywhere within a command line.
C:\> Echo This will work REM Echo But will this show
This will work REM Echo But will this show You can add a comment to the end of a command line using &REM or &:: C:\> Echo This will work &REM Echo this will not show
This will work
This approach works because '&' introduces a new command on the same line. REM does not set or clear the Errorlevel.
REM is an internal command. “I can’t stand a naked light bulb, any more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action” ~ Tennessee Williams In the text editor, Notepad++ you can add REM to the beginning of multiple lines: Select them and hit Ctrl-Q

                       In the .RCJ job file, Source/Destination paths can be given as /SD:path and /DD:path
                       /NOSD and /NODD can be used either on the command line or in the job file.
             /QUIT : QUIT after processing command line (to view parameters). 
               /IF : Include the following Files.

            /MON:n : MONitor source; run again when more than n changes seen.
            /MOT:m : MOnitor source; run again in m minutes Time, if changed.
                     This will continue until you terminate the Robocopy process with Ctrl-C.

 Exclude/Include

               /XO : Exclude Older - if destination file already exists and is the same date
                     or newer than the source, don’t overwrite it.
               /XC : Exclude Changed files.
               /XN : Exclude Newer files.
               /XL : Exclude ""Lonely"" files and dirs (present in source but not destination)
                     This will prevent any new files being added to the destination.
               /XX : Exclude ""eXtra"" files and dirs (present in destination but not source)
                     This will prevent any deletions from the destination. (this is the default)
                     Will also suppress listing extra destination files in the log.

  /XF file [file]… : Exclude Files matching given names/paths/wildcards.
  /XD dirs [dirs]… : Exclude Directories matching given names/paths.
                     XF and XD can be used in combination  e.g.
                     ROBOCOPY c:\source d:\dest /XF *.dmp ""pagefile.sys"" /XD ""c:\System Volume Information"" /S 

   /IA:[RASHCNETO] : Include files with any of the given Attributes.
   /XA:[RASHCNETO] : Exclude files with any of the given Attributes.

               /IM : Include modified MFT files. The MFT (Master File Table) contains file attributes, filenames and
                     security permissions. If the MFT timestamp is different then the destination file will be
                     overwritten even if all the attributes are the same. /IM is equivalent to /copy:DATS
                     By default robocopy ignores the file attributes and looks only at the file size and modified time.

               /IS : Include Same, overwrite files even if they are already the same.
               /IT : Include Tweaked files. If any file attribute is different the destination file is overwritten.

               /XJ : Exclude Junction points from source. (included by default).
              /XJD : Exclude junction points from source directories.
              /XJF : Exclude junction points from source files.

            /MAX:n : MAXimum file size - exclude files bigger than n bytes.
            /MIN:n : MINimum file size - exclude files smaller than n bytes.
         /MAXLAD:n : MAXimum Last Access Date - exclude files unused since n.
         /MINLAD:n : MINimum Last Access Date - exclude files used since n.
                     (If n < 1900 then n = n days, else n = YYYYMMDD date).

 Advanced options
            /BYTES : Print sizes as bytes.
            /DEBUG : Show debug volume information (undocumented)
              /ETA : Show Estimated Time of Arrival of copied files.
             /LFSM : Operate in ""low free space"" mode, enabling copy, pause and resume, see notes below.
      /LFSM:n[KMG] : /LFSM, specifying the floor size in [K:Kilo,M:Mega,G:Giga] bytes.
           /TIMFIX : FIX file TIMes on all files, even skipped files.
                /Z : Copy files in restartable mode (survive network glitch) use with caution as
                     this significantly reduces copy performance due to the extra logging.
               /ZB : Use restartable mode; if access denied use Backup mode. This option significantly

SORT,Sort input,https://ss64.com/nt/sort.html,"Syntax
      SORT [options] 

Options

   /+n   Sort the file ignoring the first one or more characters in each row.
         The default (/+1) will sort using all characters in each row.
          /+2 will start comparing at the second character, /+3 the third etc.
         Lines with fewer than n characters collate before other lines.

   /C[ASE_SENSITIVE]

         Case sensitive sort. (undocumented switch in Win7 and above)
         Dependent on the locale some characters will sort before A ('- !#) or after Z (~£¬Ξ)

  [drive:][pathname]

         The file to be sorted.
         If not specified, the standard input is sorted.
         Specifying an input file is faster than redirecting the same file as standard input.

   /L[OCALE] locale

         Override the system default locale with the specified locale.
         Only two locales are supported, the default and the ""C"" locale.
         The ""C"" locale yields the fastest collating sequence (sort order).

         By default sorting with the C locale is case insensitive, so will not consistently place
         'A' before or after 'a'.
         When both the C locale and /Case_Sensitive are specified, all capitals will sort before
         lower case, so Z before a.
         The C locale is not the same collation as LC_ALL=C in Unix.

   /M[EMORY] kilobytes

         The amount of main memory to use for the sort, in KiB.
         The best performance is usually achieved by not specifying a memory size.

         The memory size is always constrained to be a minimum of 160 KiB.
         If the memory size is specified the exact amount will be used for the sort,
         regardless of how much main memory is available.

         By default the sort will be done with one pass (no temporary file) if it fits in the
         default maximum memory size, otherwise the sort will be done in two passes
         (with the partially sorted data being stored in a temporary file) such that the
         amount of memory used for both the sort and merge passes are equal.  The default
         maximum memory size is 90% of available main memory if both the input and output are
         files, and 45% of main memory otherwise.

         SORT will only create a temporary file when required by limitations in available memory.

   /REC[ORD_MAXIMUM] characters 

         The maximum number of characters in a row or record
         (default 4096, maximum 65535)

   /R[EVERSE]  Reverse the sort order (Z to A, 9 to 0)

   /T[EMPORARY] [drive:][path]

         The path of the directory to hold SORT’s working storage, in case the data does not fit in RAM.
         The default is the system temporary directory %temp%

   /O[UTPUT] [drive:][pathname]

         The file where the sorted input is to be stored.
         If not specified, the data is written to standard output.
         Specifying an output file is faster than redirecting standard output to the same file.

   /U[NI_OUTPUT]
         Output in unicode. (undocumented switch in Win7 and above)

   /UNIQ[UE]
         Output only unique lines (undocumented switch in Windows 10 and above)","['C:\\> sort.exe ""C:\\demo\\musiclist.txt', 'C:\\> TYPE demofile.txt | sort.exe /unique', 'C:\\> DIR /b ""C:\\demo\\"" | sort.exe', 'C:\\> DIR /s /b ""C:\\demo\\"" | sort.exe /r /+260 /o C:\\logs\\allfiles.txt', 'C:\\> DIR /b | SORT /r /o demo.txt', 'C:\\> DIR /b ""folder-that-doesnt-exist"" 2>&1 | SORT /r /o demo.txt']","Sort will accept a redirected or piped file input and TYPE the

SSH,OpenSSH remote login client,https://ss64.com/nt/ssh.html,"Syntax
      SSH [options] destination [command]

Options
   -4    Use IPv4 addresses only.
   -6    Use IPv6 addresses only.

   -A    Enable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.
   -a    Disable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

   -B bind_interface
         Bind to the address of bind_interface before attempting to connect to the destination host.
         This is only useful on systems with more than one address.

   -b bind_address
         Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.
         Only useful on systems with more than one address.

   -C    Use data compression.

   -c cipher_spec
         Select the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

   -D [bind_address:]port
         Dynamic application-level port forwarding.
         This allocates a socket to listen to port on the local side.
         When a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel,
         and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

   -E log_file
         Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

   -e escape_char
         Set the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
         The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line. The escape character
         followed by a dot (.) closes the connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection;
         and followed by itself sends the escape character once.
         Setting the character to 'none' disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent. 

   -F configfile
         Specifies a per-user configuration file.
         The default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

   -f    Request ssh to go to background just before command execution.
         Useful if ssh is going to ask for a passwords, but the user wants it in the background.
         This implies -n. A recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is ssh -f host xterm.

         If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to 'yes', then a client started with -f 
         will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the background.

   -G    Causes ssh to print its configuration after evaluating Host and Match blocks and exit.

   -g    Allow remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.
         If used on a multiplexed connection, then this option must be specified on the master process. 

   -I pkcs11
         Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate with a PKCS#11 token
         providing keys for user authentication. 

   -i identity_file
         A file from which the identity key (private key) for public key authentication is read.

   -J [user@]host[:port]
         Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the pjump host[(/iam/jump-host)
         and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.

   -K    Enable GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server. 

   -k    Disable forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server. 

   -l login_name
         The user to log in as on the remote machine.

   -M    Place the ssh client into 'master mode for connection sharing.
         Multiple -M options places ssh into 'master' mode but with confirmation required using ssh-askpass(1)
         before each operation that changes the multiplexing state (e.g. opening a new session). 

   -m mac_spec
         A comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code) algorithms, specified in order of preference.

   -N    Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports. 

   -O ctl_cmd
         Control an active connection multiplexing master process.
         When the -O option is specified, the ctl_cmd argument is interpreted and passed to the master process.
         Valid commands are: 'check' (check that the master process is running), 'forward' (request forwardings
         without command execution), 'cancel' (cancel forwardings), 'exit' (request the master to exit),
         and 'stop' (request the master to stop accepting further multiplexing requests).

   -o option
         Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file. 

   -p port
         Port to connect to on the remote host.

   -Q query_option
         Query ssh for the algorithms supported for the specified version 2. The available features are:
         cipher (supported symmetric ciphers), cipher-auth (supported symmetric ciphers that support authenticated
         encryption), help (supported query terms for use with the -Q flag), mac (supported message integrity codes),
         kex (key exchange algorithms), key (key types), key-cert (certificate key types), key-plain (non-certificate
         key types), protocol-version (supported SSH protocol versions), and sig (supported signature algorithms). 

   -q    Quiet mode.
       
   -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
   -R [bind_address:]port:local_socket
   -R remote_socket:host:hostport
   -R remote_socket:local_socket
   -R [bind_address:]port
         Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded
         to the local side. 
         Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file. Privileged ports can be forwarded only when
         logging in as root on the remote machine. Specify IPv6 addresses be enclosing the address in square brackets.

   -S ctl_path
         Specifies the location of a control socket for connection sharing, or the string 'none' to disable connection sharing.
         Refer to the description of ControlPath and ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for details.

   -T    Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

   -t    Force pseudo-terminal allocation.
         This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful,
         e.g. when implementing menu services. Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.

   -V    Display the version number.

   -v    Verbose mode.

   -W host:port
         Request that standard input and output on the client be forwarded to host on port over the secure channel.
         Implies -N, -T, ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings, though these can be overridden in the configuration
         file or using -o command line options.

   -w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
         Request tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4) devices between the client (local_tun) and
         the server (remote_tun). The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword 'any', which uses the next
         available tunnel device. If remote_tun is not specified, it defaults to 'any'.
         See also the Tunnel and TunnelDevice directives in ssh_config(5).

         If the Tunnel directive is unset, it will be set to the default tunnel mode, which is 'point-to-point'.
         If a different Tunnel forwarding mode it desired, then it should be specified before -w.

   -X    Enable X11 forwarding. This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.
         X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
         host (for the user’s X authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded
         connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.

         For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.
         Please refer to the ssh -Y option and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for more information.

   -x    Disable X11 forwarding. 

   -Y    Enable trusted X11 forwarding. Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls. 
   -y    Send log information using the syslog(3) system module. By default this information is sent to stderr.","['C:\\> powershell ""Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0""', 'C:\\> ssh.exe -l xiaoping ssh.example.com', 'C:\\> ssh xiaoping@ssh.example.com']","OpenSSH remote login client.

Key
  -addtarget     Storage location for backups. A disk, volume, or UNC path.
  -allCritical   Include all critical volumes in the backups. Use only with -backupTarget. Can be used with -include.
  -allowDeleteOldBackups  Overwrite any backups made before the computer was upgraded.
  -authsysvol    If used, performs an authoritative restore of SYSVOL (the System Volume shared directory).
  -autoReboot    Restart the system at the end of the system state recovery operation.
                 This parameter is valid only for a recovery to the original location.
                 We do not recommend you use this parameter if you need to perform steps after the recovery operation.

  -backupTarget  The storage location for this backup. Requires an HD drive letter, a volume GUID-based path or UNC path.

  -exclude       A comma-delimited list of items to exclude from the backup: files, folders, or volumes.
  -include       A comma-delimited list of items to include in the backup: multiple files, folders, or volumes.

  -excludeDisks  Valid only when specified with -recreateDisks and must be input as a comma-delimited list of
                 disk identifiers (as listed in the output of wbadmin get disks).
                 Excluded disks are not partitioned or formatted. This parameter helps preserve data on disks that
                 you do not want modified during the recovery operation.

  -hyperv        A comma-delimited list of components to be included in backup.
                 The identifier could be a component name or component GUID (with or without braces).

  -machine       The computer that you want backup details for. Use when backups of multiple computers are stored together.

  -nonRecurseExclude   Non-recursive, comma-delimited list of items to exclude from the backup.
  -nonRecurseInclude   Non-recursive, comma-delimited list of items to include in the backup. 
                       Use only with the -backupTarget parameter.

  -noRollForward Valid only when recovering applications. Allows for previous point-in-time recovery of an application
                 if the latest version from the backups is selected.
                 For other versions of the application that are not the latest, previous point-in-time recovery
                 is done as the default.

  -noVerify      Specifies that backups saved to removable media (such as a DVD) are not verified for errors.
  -noInheritAcl  Apply the access control list (ACL) permissions that correspond to the credentials provided by the
                  -user and -password parameters to the folder that contains the backup.

  -overwrite     Valid only when recovering files. If a file being recovered already exists:
                     Skip       - Skip the existing file and continue with recovery of the next file.
                     CreateCopy - Create a copy of the existing file so that the existing file is not modified.
                     Overwrite  - Overwrite the existing file with the file from the backup.

  -recoveryTarget  The location to restore to.
                   Use if this location is different than the location that was previously backed up.

  -recreateDisks Recover a disk configuration to the state that existed when the backup was created.
                 Warning: This parameter deletes all data on volumes that host Operating System components.
                 It might also delete data from data volumes.

  -recursive     Valid only when recovering files. Recover the files in the folders and all sub-folders.
                 By default, only files which reside directly in the specified folders are recovered.

  -restoreAllVolumes  Recover all volumes from the selected backup. If this parameter is not specified, only critical
                 volumes (volumes that contain the system state and Operating System components) are recovered.
                 This parameter is useful when you need to recover non-critical volumes during system recovery.

  -schedule      Times of day to create a backup, formatted as HH:MM and comma delimited.
  -showsummary   Report the summary of the last system state recovery (after the restart required to complete the operation).
                 This parameter cannot be accompanied by any other parameters.

  -skipBadClusterCheck   Skip checking the recovery disks for bad cluster information. If you are restoring to an alternate
                 server or hardware, we recommend that you do not use this parameter.
                 You can manually run chkdsk /b on your recovery disks at any time to check them for bad clusters, and then
                 update the file system information accordingly.
                 Warning: Until you run chkdsk the bad clusters reported on your recovered system may not be accurate.

  -systemState   Create a backup that includes the system state in addition to items specified with the -include.

  -user          The user with write permission to the backup storage destination.
                 A member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group on the computer being backed up.
  -password      The password for -user.

  -version       The version of the backup in MM/DD/YYYY-HH:MM format.
                 To view version information, type 'wbadmin get versions'.

  -vssFull       Perform a full back up using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).
                 All files are backed up, each file’s history is updated to reflect that it was backed up, and the logs
                 of previous backups may be truncated.
                 Do not use this parameter if you are using a product other than Windows Server Backup to back up
                 applications that are on the volumes included in the current backup. Doing so can potentially
                 break the incremental, differential, or other type of backups that the other backup product
                 is creating because the history that they rely on might be missing and they might perform
                 a full backup unnecessarily.

  -vssCopy       Perform a copy backup using VSS. All files are backed up but the history of the files being backup up
                 is not updated so you preserve the all the change information and log files.
                 This is the default value. A copy backup cannot be used for incremental or differential backups or restores.

      WINMGMT [/verifyrepository path]
      WINMGMT [/salvagerepository] 
      WINMGMT [/resetrepository]

Options:

   /backup filename
      Back up the repository to the specified file name.
      The filename argument should contain the full path to the file location.
      This process requires a write lock on the repository so that write operations to the repository are suspended
      until the backup process is completed.
      If you do not specify a path for the file, it is saved to the %Windir%\System32 directory.

   /restore filename restore-mode
      Manually restore the WMI repository from the specified backup file.
      The filename argument should contain the full path to the backup file location.
      To perform the restore operation, WMI saves the existing repository to write back if the operation fails.
      Then the repository is restored from the backup file that is specified in the filename argument.
      If exclusive access to the repository cannot be achieved, existing clients are disconnected from WMI.

      The restore_mode flag must be a 1 (force disconnect users and restore)
      or 0 (default restore if no users connected).

   /resyncperf winmgmt-service-process-id
      Register the computer’s performance libraries with WMI. WMI PID is the process ID for the WMI service.
      Only needed if the performance monitor classes are not returning reliable results.

   /standalonehost [level]
      Move the Winmgmt service to a standalone Svchost process that has a fixed DCOM endpoint.
      The default endpoint is ""ncacn_ip_tcp.0.24158"". However, the endpoint may be changed by running Dcomcnfg.exe.
      For more information about setting up a fixed port for WMI, see Setting Up a Fixed Port for WMI.

      The level argument is the authentication level for the Svchost process. WMI normally runs as part of a shared service host and
      you cannot increase the authentication level for WMI alone.
      If level is not specified, the default is 4 (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT or WbemAuthenticationLevelPkt).

      You can run WMI more securely by increasing the authentication level to Packet Privacy
      (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY or WbemAuthenticationLevelPktPrivacy).
      The authentication levels for Visual Basic and scripting are described in WbemAuthenticationLevelEnum.
      For C++, see Setting the Default Process Security Level Using C++. For more information, see Maintaining WMI Security.

   /sharedhost
      Move the Winmgmt service into the shared Svchost process.

   /verifyrepository path
      Performs a consistency check on the WMI repository.
      When you add the /verifyrepository switch without the path argument, then the live repository currently used by WMI is verified.
      When you specify the path argument, you can verify any saved copy of the repository.
      In this case, the path argument should contain the full path to the saved repository copy. The saved repository should be a copy of the
      entire repository folder. For more information about errors returned by this command, see the Remarks section.

   /salvagerepository
      Perform a consistency check on the WMI repository, and if an inconsistency is detected, rebuild the repository.
      The content of the inconsistent repository is merged into the rebuilt repository, if it can be read.
      The salvage operation always works with the repository that the WMI service is currently using.
      For more information about errors returned by this command, see the Remarks section.
      % MOF files that contain the #pragma autorecover preprocessor statement are restored to the repository.

   /resetrepository
      The repository is reset to the initial state when the Operating System is first installed.
      MOF files that contain the #pragma autorecover preprocessor statement are restored to the repository.

WINRS,Windows Remote Shell,https://ss64.com/nt/winrs.html,"Syntax
      WINRS [-/SWITCH[:VALUE]] command

Key
   command    Any string that can be executed as a command in the cmd.exe shell.

           (All switches accept both short form or long form. For example both -r and 
            -remote are valid.)

   -r[emote]:ENDPOINT        The target endpoint using a NetBIOS name or the standard
                             connection URL: [TRANSPORT://]TARGET[:PORT].
                             If not specified  -r:localhost is used.

   -un[encrypted]            Messages to the remote shell will not be encrypted. This is useful for
                             troubleshooting, or when the network traffic is already encrypted using
                             ipsec, or when physical security is enforced.
                             By default the messages are encrypted using Kerberos or NTLM keys.
                             This switch is ignored when HTTPS transport is selected. 

   -u[sername]:USERNAME      Username. If -username is specified, -password must be as well.
                             If not specified Winrs will negotiate authentication or prompt. 

   -p[assword]:PASSWORD      Password. If not specified winrs will prompt for it.

   -d[irectory]:PATH         The starting directory for remote shell.
                             If not specified the remote shell will start in %USERPROFILE%.

   -env[ironment]:STRING=VALUE
                             A single environment variable to be set when shell starts.
                             This allows changing default environment for the shell.
                             Multiple occurrences of this switch can be used.

   -noe[cho]                 Disable echo. This might be necessary to ensure that user’s answers
                             to remote prompts are not displayed locally. By default echo is ""on"".

   -nop[rofile]              Do not load the user’s profile. By default the server will attempt to load
                             the user profile. If the remote user is not a local administrator on the
                             target system then this option will be required.

   -comp[ression]            Turn on compression.  Older installations on remote machines may
                             not support compression so it is off by default.

   -[use]ssl                 Use an SSL connection when using a remote endpoint. Specifying this instead
                             of the transport ""https:"" will use the default WinRM default port.

   /extract    Extract the package contents to a destination folder.

   /kb:#####   Uninstall a package led by using its KB number. Use only together with /uninstall.

   /quiet      Run Wusa.exe in quiet mode without user interaction.
               This option has been deprecated, uninstalling updates quietly could be a security risk
               because malicious software could quietly uninstall an update in the background
               without user intervention.

   /norestart  Prevent Wusa.exe from restarting the computer.
               The /norestart switch is ignored if the /quiet switch is not present.
               If you run Wusa.exe together with these two switches, you must manually restart the
               Operating System after the installation is complete (if the installation requires a restart)

               For example, if the Windows6.0-KB934307-x86.msu file is in the D:\934307 folder, type
               the following command to install the update package:

   /warnrestart

               begins a restart for install and uninstall operations.

   /forcerestart
               When this switch is combined with the /quiet switch, Wusa.exe forcibly closes

         The files can each contain one or more full or partial pathnames to be excluded.
         When any of these match any part of the absolute path of a SOURCE file, then 
         that file will be excluded.
         For example, specifying a string like \obj\ or .obj will exclude all files

   /Z         Copy files in restartable mode. If the copy is interrupted part way through,
              it will restart if possible. use with caution as this significantly
              reduces copy performance due to the extra logging.

         Do not include empty folders or subfolders.
   /T /E will include empty folders and subfolders.

   /K    Copy attributes. XCOPY will otherwise reset read-only attributes.

   /N    If at all possible, use only a short filename (8.3) when creating
         a destination file. This can be necessary when copying between disks
         that are formatted differently e.g NTFS and VFAT, or when archiving

::,Comment / Remark •,https://ss64.com/nt/rem.html,C:\> Echo Hello       & REM this doesnt matter,"['Hello', 'FOR... DO(...)', '::', ':: This line is a comment ^\r\nand so is this.', '@Echo off\r\nEcho This is an example of an %= Inline Comment =% in the middle of a line.', ';', 'C:\\WORK>type ftpscript\r\n!REM This is a remark\r\nbye']","In a batch file 
REM at the start of a line signifies a comment or REMARK. An alternative is adding :: at
the start of a line, this has a similar effect to REM. Double colons act like a GOTO or CALL :label the second colon is  invalid as a name  but is still treated as a label, and so the line is always skipped. @ECHO OFF
::
:: First comment
REM Second comment
REM
Echo Hello REM This remark is displayed by echo
Echo Hello & REM This remark is ignored by echo
Copy work.xls backup.xls &:: We backed up the file

Although you can use REM without a comment to add vertical spacing to a batch
file, you can also use completely blank lines. The blank lines are ignored when processing
the batch program. The double-colon :: is not documented as a comment command. An important limitation of this is that as a label it can only be used at the beginning of the line. Also because the double colon is a command, it will be displayed if you run a batch file without @ECHO OFF A REM comment is slightly slower to process than :: (360µs versus 58µs per comment line)
A REM comment is a documented command that may be used almost anywhere within a command line.
C:\> Echo This will work REM Echo But will this show
This will work REM Echo But will this show You can add a comment to the end of a command line using &REM or &:: C:\> Echo This will work &REM Echo this will not show
This will work
This approach works because '&' introduces a new command on the same line. REM does not set or clear the Errorlevel.
REM is an internal command. “I can’t stand a naked light bulb, any more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action” ~ Tennessee Williams In the text editor, Notepad++ you can add REM to the beginning of multiple lines: Select them and hit Ctrl-Q
Equivalent PowerShell: # - Comment / Remark.
Equivalent  bash command: # - Comment / Remark."
