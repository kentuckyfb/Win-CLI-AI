   /clear  Remove all entries from the global object access auditing list.

   /exclude
           Specified with /user; indicates that the user’s per-user policy will cause an audit to be
           suppressed regardless of the system audit policy.
           This setting is ignored for users who are members of the local Administrators group.

   /subcategory
           Display or set one or more audit subcategories by GUID or name.
           If no user is specified, the system policy is set.

   /failure
           Specifies failure auditing. This setting must be used with a parameter indicating whether
           to enable or disable the setting.

   /file:filename
           A file name for the backup or restore.


   /include
           Specified with /user; indicates that the user’s per-user policy will cause an audit to be
           generated even if it is not specified by the system audit policy.
           This setting is the default and is automatically applied if neither the /include nor /exclude

      BCDEdit /Command [Argument1] [Argument2] ...

Key
      /? command   To display detailed help for a particular command, run bcdedit /? command,
                    where command is the name of the command you are searching for more information about.
                    e.g. bcdedit /? createstore

   Store commands:

      /createstore  Creates a new empty boot configuration data store.
                    The created store is not a system store.

      /export       Export the contents of the system store into a file.
                    This file can be used later to restore the state of the system store.
                    Valid only for the system store.

      /import       Restore the state of the system store by using a backup data file
                    previously generated with /export.
                    This command deletes any existing entries in the system store before
                    the import takes place. Valid only for the system store.

      /store        This option can be used with most BCDedit commands to specify
                    the store to be used. If this option is not specified, then
                    BCDEdit operates on the system store.
                    Running the bcdedit /store command by itself is equivalent to running
                    the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /sysstore     Set the system store device. This only affects EFI-based systems.
                    It does not persist across reboots, and is only used in cases where the system
                    store device is ambiguous.

   Operating on entries in a store:

      /copy         Make a copy of a specified boot entry in the same system store.

      /create       Create a new entry in the boot configuration data store.
                    If a well-known identifier is specified, then the /application, /inherit, and
                    /device options cannot be specified. If an identifier is not specified or not well
                    known, an /application, /inherit, or /device option must be specified. 

      /delete       Delete an element from a specified entry.

      /mirror       Create a mirror of entries in the store.

   Changing entry options:

      /deletevalue  Delete a specified element from a boot entry.

      /set          Set an entry option value.

   List current settings:

      /enum [type | id] [/v]
                    List entries in a store.
                    Types: ACTIVE, FIRMWARE, BOOTAPP, BOOTMGR, OSLOADER, RESUME, INHERIT, ALL
                    The /enum option is the default value for BCEdit, so running
                    the bcdedit command without options is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /v            Verbose mode.
                    Usually, any well-known entry identifiers are represented by their friendly shorthand form.
                    Specifying /v as a command-line option displays all identifiers in full.
                    Running the bcdedit /v command by itself is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active /v command.

   Controlling the boot manager:

      /bootsequence Specifies a one-time display order to be used for the next boot.
                    This command is similar to the /displayorder option, except that it is used only the
                    next time the computer starts. Afterwards, the computer reverts to the original
                    display order.
      /default      Specifies the default entry that the boot manager selects when the timeout expires.

      /displayorder Specifies the display order that the boot manager uses when displaying boot options
                    to a user.
      /timeout      Specifies the time to wait, in seconds, before the boot manager selects the default entry.

      /toolsdisplayorder  Specifies the display order for the boot manager to use when displaying the Tools menu.

   Emergency Management Services options:

      /bootems      Enable or disable Emergency Management Services (EMS) for the specified entry.

      /ems          Enable or disable EMS for the specified Operating System boot entry.

      /emssettings  Set the global EMS settings for the computer.
                    /emssettings does not enable or disable EMS for any particular boot entry.

   Debugging:

      /bootdebug    Enable or disable the boot debugger for a specified boot entry.
                    Although this command works for any boot entry, it is effective only for boot applications.

      /dbgsettings  Specifies or displays the global debugger settings for the system.
                    This command does not enable or disable the kernel debugger; use the /debug option for
                    that purpose. To set an individual global debugger setting, use the
                    bcdedit /setdbgsettings type value command.

      /debug        Enable or disable the kernel debugger for a specified boot entry.

      /hypervisorsettings  Set the hypervisor parameters.

   Undocumented:

      /loglevel level [/raw]

                 level is one of the following:
                     t  : trace (stdout)
                     i  : info (stdout)
                     w  : warning (stderr)

      /sysstore     Set the system store device. This only affects EFI-based systems.
                    It does not persist across reboots, and is only used in cases where the system
                    store device is ambiguous.

   Operating on entries in a store:

      /copy         Make a copy of a specified boot entry in the same system store.

      /create       Create a new entry in the boot configuration data store.
                    If a well-known identifier is specified, then the /application, /inherit, and
                    /device options cannot be specified. If an identifier is not specified or not well
                    known, an /application, /inherit, or /device option must be specified. 

      /delete       Delete an element from a specified entry.

      /mirror       Create a mirror of entries in the store.

   Changing entry options:

      /deletevalue  Delete a specified element from a boot entry.

      /set          Set an entry option value.

   List current settings:

      /enum [type | id] [/v]
                    List entries in a store.
                    Types: ACTIVE, FIRMWARE, BOOTAPP, BOOTMGR, OSLOADER, RESUME, INHERIT, ALL
                    The /enum option is the default value for BCEdit, so running
                    the bcdedit command without options is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /v            Verbose mode.
                    Usually, any well-known entry identifiers are represented by their friendly shorthand form.
                    Specifying /v as a command-line option displays all identifiers in full.
                    Running the bcdedit /v command by itself is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active /v command.

   Controlling the boot manager:

      /bootsequence Specifies a one-time display order to be used for the next boot.
                    This command is similar to the /displayorder option, except that it is used only the
                    next time the computer starts. Afterwards, the computer reverts to the original
                    display order.
      /default      Specifies the default entry that the boot manager selects when the timeout expires.

      /displayorder Specifies the display order that the boot manager uses when displaying boot options
                    to a user.
      /timeout      Specifies the time to wait, in seconds, before the boot manager selects the default entry.

      /toolsdisplayorder  Specifies the display order for the boot manager to use when displaying the Tools menu.

   Emergency Management Services options:

      /bootems      Enable or disable Emergency Management Services (EMS) for the specified entry.

      /ems          Enable or disable EMS for the specified Operating System boot entry.

      /emssettings  Set the global EMS settings for the computer.
                    /emssettings does not enable or disable EMS for any particular boot entry.

   Debugging:

      /bootdebug    Enable or disable the boot debugger for a specified boot entry.
                    Although this command works for any boot entry, it is effective only for boot applications.

      /dbgsettings  Specifies or displays the global debugger settings for the system.
                    This command does not enable or disable the kernel debugger; use the /debug option for
                    that purpose. To set an individual global debugger setting, use the
                    bcdedit /setdbgsettings type value command.

      /debug        Enable or disable the kernel debugger for a specified boot entry.

      /hypervisorsettings  Set the hypervisor parameters.

      DISKPART /s scriptname.txt

      DISKPART /s scriptname.txt > logfile.txt

Key
   /s scriptname.txt (one command per line)
         To create a diskpart script, create a text file scriptname.txt containing the Diskpart commands that you 
         want to run, one command per line, and no empty lines. Start a line with REM to make the line a comment.

Commands you can issue at the DISKPART prompt or in a text file:

 ACTIVE  On basic disks, mark the partition with focus as active.

         DiskPart does not check the contents of the partition. If you mistakenly mark a partition as active
         and it does not contain the Operating System startup files, your computer might not start.
         This informs the basic input/output system (BIOS) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) that
         the partition or volume is a valid system partition or system volume.
         Only partitions can be marked as active. A partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.
         Use the select partition command to select a partition and shift the focus to it.

 ADD disk=n [align=n] [wait] [noerr]
         Mirror the simple volume with focus to the specified disk.

 ASSIGN  [{LETTER=D  | mount=path}] [noerr]
         Assign a drive letter or mount point to the volume with focus. (Only Server 2012-2022)

         If no drive letter or mount point is specified, the next available drive letter is assigned.
         By using the assign command, you can change the drive letter associated with a removable drive.
         You cannot assign drive letters to system volumes, boot volumes, or volumes that contain the paging file.
         In addition, you cannot assign a drive letter to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partition
         or any GUID Partition Table (gpt) partition other than a basic data partition.
         A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.
         Use the select volume command to select a volume and shift the focus to it.
         ## Example To assign the letter E to the volume in focus, type: assign letter=e

 ATTRIBUTES DISK [{set | clear}] [readonly] [noerr] ATTRIBUTES VOLUME [{set | clear}] [{hidden | readonly | nodefaultdriveletter | shadowcopy}] [noerr]
         Display, set, or clear the attributes of a disk or volume.

 AUTOMOUNT [enable] [disable] [scrub] [noerr]
         Enable or disable the automount feature.

 BREAK disk=n [nokeep] [noerr]
         Break the mirrored volume with focus into two simple volumes.

 CLEAN [all]       (Server 2012-2022)
         Remove any and all partition or volume formatting from the disk with focus, 'all' will Zero the disk.
         See also the PowerShell cmdlet clear-disk

 COMPACT vdisk       (Windows Server 2008R2-2022)
         Reduce the physical size of a dynamically expanding virtual hard disk (VHD) file.
         This parameter is useful because dynamically expanding VHDs increase in size as you add files, but they do
         not automatically reduce in size when you delete files.

 CONVERT Convert file allocation table (FAT) and FAT32 volumes to the NTFS file system. 

 CREATE partition efi [size=n] [offset=n] [noerr]
 CREATE partition extended [size=n] [offset=n] [align=n] [noerr]

 CREATE partition msr [size=n] [offset=n] [noerr]
 CREATE partition primary [size=n] [offset=n] [id={ byte | guid }] [align=n] [noerr]
         Create a partition.

 CREATE volume raid [size=n] disk=n,n,n[,n,...] [align=n] [noerr]
 CREATE volume simple [size=n] [disk=n] [align=n] [noerr]
 CREATE volume stripe [size=n] disk=n,n[,n,...] [align=n] [noerr]
 CREATE volume mirror [size=n] disk=n,n[,n,...] [align=n] [noerr]
         Create a volume.

 CREATE vdisk file=filepath {[type={fixed|expandable}] | [parent=filepath] | [source=filepath]}
                      [maximum=n] [sd=SDDL] [noerr]
         Create a virtual disk (VHD).

 DELETE disk [noerr] [override]
 DELETE partition [noerr] [override]
 DELETE volume [noerr]
         Delete a partition, volume or a dynamic disk from the list of disks.

 DETAIL Disk

         Display properties of the selected disk/volume/partition, display the disks on which the current volume resides:

 EXIT    Exit Diskpart

 EXPAND vdisk maximum=n
         Expand the max size (in MB) available on a virtual disk (Windows Server 2008R2-2022).

 EXTEND [size=n] [disk=n] [noerr]
 EXTEND filesystem [noerr]
         Extend a volume or partition with focus and its file system into free space on a disk.
            size= The space in MB.
            disk= The disk on which the volume or partition is extended. Default = current disk.

         Display the current and supported file systems on the volume (Use 'Select Volume' first)

 FORMAT [[FS=FS] [REVISION=X.XX] | RECOMMENDED] [LABEL=""label""] [UNIT=N]
            [QUICK] [COMPRESS] [OVERRIDE] [DUPLICATE] [NOWAIT] [noerr]
         Format a disk for use with Windows.

 GPT attributes=n     (Windows Server 2012-2022)  OEM use only.
      On basic GUID partition table (gpt) disks, this command assigns the gpt attribute(s) to the partition with focus.
      Gpt partition attributes give additional information about the use of the partition.
      Some attributes are specific to the partition type GUID.
      This might cause your basic data volumes to fail to be assigned drive letters, or to prevent the file system from mounting. 

 HELP [command]

 IMPORT
         Imports a transportable shadow copy from a loaded metadata file into the system.
         Before you can use import, you must load a DiskShadow metadata file using the load metadata command.

 MERGE vdisk depth=n           (Windows Server 2008R2-2022)
         Merge a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD) with its corresponding parent VHD.
         depth=1 will merge with parent.
         The parent VHD will be modified to include the modifications from the differencing VHD.
         As a result, other differencing VHDs that are dependent on the parent will no longer be valid.
         You must choose and detach a VHD for this operation to succeed.
         Use the 'select vdisk' command to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.

         Format a disk for use with Windows.

 GPT attributes=n     (Windows Server 2012-2022)  OEM use only.
      On basic GUID partition table (gpt) disks, this command assigns the gpt attribute(s) to the partition with focus.
      Gpt partition attributes give additional information about the use of the partition.
      Some attributes are specific to the partition type GUID.
      This might cause your basic data volumes to fail to be assigned drive letters, or to prevent the file system from mounting. 

 HELP [command]

 IMPORT
         Imports a transportable shadow copy from a loaded metadata file into the system.
         Before you can use import, you must load a DiskShadow metadata file using the load metadata command.

 INACTIVE
         On basic master boot record (MBR) disks, marks the system partition or boot partition
         with focus as inactive [don’t boot]. Use 'Select Partition' first.
         Your computer might not start without an active partition.

 MERGE vdisk depth=n           (Windows Server 2008R2-2022)
         Merge a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD) with its corresponding parent VHD.
         depth=1 will merge with parent.
         The parent VHD will be modified to include the modifications from the differencing VHD.
         As a result, other differencing VHDs that are dependent on the parent will no longer be valid.
         You must choose and detach a VHD for this operation to succeed.
         Use the 'select vdisk' command to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.

 OFFLINE disk [noerr]

                        This option allows you to specify the partition that you want to optimize.

    This command should be the last command run against an image before the image is applied to a device,
    and can reduce time on the factory floor when building devices for build-to-stock scenarios.

     DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image {/Boot | /WimBoot}

     /Boot  Tries to reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            This optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed on the image
            after optimizing it.  DISM /Optimize-Image /boot is available in the following Operating Systems: Windows 11,
            Windows 10, version 1607,Windows 10, version 1809 and later, Windows Server 2012 R2 later

            Use /Boot to try and reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            Note that this optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed
            on the image after optimizing it.
     /WimBoot is for configuring an offline image for installing on a WIMBoot system.

    Examples: DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image /Boot

      dism.exe /Apply-SiloedPackage from the target folder created by CopyDandI.cmd.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage can only be run once against a Windows image, but /PackagePath can used more than once
      in the same command to apply multiple SPPs. SPPs will be applied in the specified order, so a dependency should
      be specified before the SPP that depends on it. see Siloed provisioning packages.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:package_path /ImagePath:applied_image_path

      /PackagePath - Specifies the path of a siloed provisioning package file.
      /ImagePath - Specifies the path of the Windows image where you are applying the SPP.

     /PartitionNumber - By default /Optimize-FFU optimizes the OS partition.
                        This option allows you to specify the partition that you want to optimize.

    This command should be the last command run against an image before the image is applied to a device,
    and can reduce time on the factory floor when building devices for build-to-stock scenarios.

     DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image {/Boot | /WimBoot}

     /Boot  Tries to reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            This optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed on the image
            after optimizing it.  DISM /Optimize-Image /boot is available in the following Operating Systems: Windows 11,
            Windows 10, version 1607,Windows 10, version 1809 and later, Windows Server 2012 R2 later

            Use /Boot to try and reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            Note that this optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed
            on the image after optimizing it.
     /WimBoot is for configuring an offline image for installing on a WIMBoot system.

    Examples: DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image /Boot

      dism.exe /Apply-SiloedPackage from the target folder created by CopyDandI.cmd.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage can only be run once against a Windows image, but /PackagePath can used more than once
      in the same command to apply multiple SPPs. SPPs will be applied in the specified order, so a dependency should
      be specified before the SPP that depends on it. see Siloed provisioning packages.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:package_path /ImagePath:applied_image_path

      /PackagePath - Specifies the path of a siloed provisioning package file.
      /ImagePath - Specifies the path of the Windows image where you are applying the SPP.
    Example: 
      DISM.exe /apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:C:\test\Word.spp /PackagePath:C:\test\spp2.spp /ImagePath:C:\

   /Split-Ffu /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /SFUFile:path_to_sfu
      /FileSize:MB-Size [/CheckIntegrity] 

     /FileSize - The maximum size in megabytes (MB) for each created file. 
                 If a single file is larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option, one of the
                 split .swm files that results will be larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option,
                 in order to accommodate the large file.

     /CheckIntegrity
                 Detect and track .wim file corruption when used with capture, unmount, export, and commit operations.
                 /CheckIntegrity stops the operation if DISM detects that the .wim file is corrupted when used
                 with apply and mount operations.

     /ImageFile  Specifies the path of a .FFU file, example: flash.ffu.
     /SFUFile    References split FFU files (SFUs). Pattern is the naming pattern and location of split files.

                        This option allows you to specify the partition that you want to optimize.

    This command should be the last command run against an image before the image is applied to a device,
    and can reduce time on the factory floor when building devices for build-to-stock scenarios.

     DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image {/Boot | /WimBoot}

     /Boot  Tries to reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            This optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed on the image
            after optimizing it.  DISM /Optimize-Image /boot is available in the following Operating Systems: Windows 11,
            Windows 10, version 1607,Windows 10, version 1809 and later, Windows Server 2012 R2 later

            Note that this optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed
            on the image after optimizing it.
     /WimBoot is for configuring an offline image for installing on a WIMBoot system.

    Examples: DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image /Boot
              DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image /WimBoot

    Applies one or more siloed provisioning packages (SPPs) to a specified image.
      This option is only available after running CopyDandI.cmd from the ADK, Version 1607 or later, and running
      dism.exe /Apply-SiloedPackage from the target folder created by CopyDandI.cmd.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage can only be run once against a Windows image, but /PackagePath can used more than once
      in the same command to apply multiple SPPs. SPPs will be applied in the specified order, so a dependency should
      be specified before the SPP that depends on it. see Siloed provisioning packages.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:package_path /ImagePath:applied_image_path

      /PackagePath - Specifies the path of a siloed provisioning package file.
      /ImagePath - Specifies the path of the Windows image where you are applying the SPP.
    Example: 
      DISM.exe /apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:C:\test\Word.spp /PackagePath:C:\test\spp2.spp /ImagePath:C:\

    Split an existing .ffu file into multiple read-only split FFU files. 
   /Split-Ffu /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /SFUFile:path_to_sfu
      /FileSize:MB-Size [/CheckIntegrity] 

     /FileSize - The maximum size in megabytes (MB) for each created file. 
                 If a single file is larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option, one of the
                 split .swm files that results will be larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option,
                 in order to accommodate the large file.

     /CheckIntegrity
                 Detect and track .wim file corruption when used with capture, unmount, export, and commit operations.
                 /CheckIntegrity stops the operation if DISM detects that the .wim file is corrupted when used
                 with apply and mount operations.

     /ImageFile  Specifies the path of a .FFU file, example: flash.ffu.
     /SFUFile    References split FFU files (SFUs). Pattern is the naming pattern and location of split files.

    Example: 
      DISM.exe /Split-Ffu /ImageFile:flash.ffu /SFUFile:flash.sfu /FileSize:650

  pattern and location of split files. 

    Examples: 
      DISM.exe /Apply-Ffu /ImageFile:flash.ffu 
        /ApplyDrive:\\.\PhysicalDrive0 

   Capture a physical disk image to a new FFU file:
   /Capture-Ffu /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /CaptureDrive:physical_drive_path 
     /Name:Name [/Description:Description] [/PlatformIds:platform_ids] 
        [/Compress:{default|none}] 

     /PlatformIds  - One or more platform ids (separate with semicolon) to be add
                     to the image. If not specified, platform id will be '*'.

        /Compress:default 

    Optimize an FFU image to be faster to deploy, and more easily deployed to differently-sized disks.
   /Optimize-FFU /ImageFile:path-to-ffu-file [/PartitionNumber:PartitionNumber]

     /ImageFile     - Path to the FFU you want to optimize.
     /PartitionNumber - By default /Optimize-FFU optimizes the OS partition.
                        This option allows you to specify the partition that you want to optimize.

    This command should be the last command run against an image before the image is applied to a device,
    and can reduce time on the factory floor when building devices for build-to-stock scenarios.

     DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image {/Boot | /WimBoot}

     /Boot  Tries to reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            This optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed on the image
            after optimizing it.  DISM /Optimize-Image /boot is available in the following Operating Systems: Windows 11,
            Windows 10, version 1607,Windows 10, version 1809 and later, Windows Server 2012 R2 later

            Use /Boot to try and reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            Note that this optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed
            on the image after optimizing it.
     /WimBoot is for configuring an offline image for installing on a WIMBoot system.

    Examples: DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image /Boot
              DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Optimize-Image /WimBoot

    Applies one or more siloed provisioning packages (SPPs) to a specified image.
      This option is only available after running CopyDandI.cmd from the ADK, Version 1607 or later, and running
      dism.exe /Apply-SiloedPackage from the target folder created by CopyDandI.cmd.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage can only be run once against a Windows image, but /PackagePath can used more than once
      in the same command to apply multiple SPPs. SPPs will be applied in the specified order, so a dependency should
      be specified before the SPP that depends on it. see Siloed provisioning packages.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:package_path /ImagePath:applied_image_path

      /PackagePath - Specifies the path of a siloed provisioning package file.
      /ImagePath - Specifies the path of the Windows image where you are applying the SPP.
    Example: 
      DISM.exe /apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:C:\test\Word.spp /PackagePath:C:\test\spp2.spp /ImagePath:C:\

    Split an existing .ffu file into multiple read-only split FFU files. 
   /Split-Ffu /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /SFUFile:path_to_sfu
      /FileSize:MB-Size [/CheckIntegrity] 

     /FileSize - The maximum size in megabytes (MB) for each created file. 
                 If a single file is larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option, one of the
                 split .swm files that results will be larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option,
                 in order to accommodate the large file.

     /CheckIntegrity
                 Detect and track .wim file corruption when used with capture, unmount, export, and commit operations.
                 /CheckIntegrity stops the operation if DISM detects that the .wim file is corrupted when used
                 with apply and mount operations.

     /ImageFile  Specifies the path of a .FFU file, example: flash.ffu.
     /SFUFile    References split FFU files (SFUs). Pattern is the naming pattern and location of split files.

    Example: 
      DISM.exe /Split-Ffu /ImageFile:flash.ffu /SFUFile:flash.sfu /FileSize:650

   volume          The drive letter (followed by a colon), mount point, or volume name.
                   that you want to format. If you don’t specify any of the following command-line
                   options, format uses the volume type to determine the default format for the disk.

   /FS:file-system The type of file system (FAT, FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, UDF, ReFS).
   /A:size         Override the default allocation unit size. Also known as Cluster size.
                   Default settings are strongly recommended for general use. See below for allocation unit sizes.
                   NTFS compression is not supported for allocation unit sizes above 4096.

   /C              Compression, files added to the new disk will be compressed by default (NTFS only).

   /D              UDF 2.50 only: Metadata will be duplicated.

   /DAX[:state]    NTFS Only: Enable direct access storage (DAX) mode for this volume.
                   In DAX mode, the volume is accessed via the memory bus, boosting IO performance.
                   A volume can be formatted with DAX mode only if the hardware is DAX capable. 
                   State can specify ""enable"" or ""disable"".   * Windows 10+
                   /DAX is considered as /DAX:enable.

   /F:size         The size of the floppy disk to format (720, 1.2, 1.44, 2.88, or 20.8).

   /I:state        ReFS only: enable integrity on the new volume.
                   ""state"" is either ""enable"" or ""disable""
                   Integrity is enabled on storage that supports data redundancy
                   by default.

   /L              NTFS Only: Use large file record segments (FRS).
                   By default, the volume will be formatted with small size file records.
                   Use this to host very large files, such as VDHX files larger than 1 TB.
                   This increases the number of extents allowed per file on the volume.

   /LogSize[:size] NTFS Only: The size for NTFS log file in kilobytes.
                   The minimum supported size is 2MB, so specifying size smaller than 2MB will
                   result in a 2MB log file.  Zero indicates the default value which generally
                   depend on the volume size.   * Windows 10+

   /N:sectors      The number of sectors per track.

   /NoRepairLogs   NTFS Only: Disable NTFS repair logs.   * Windows 10+
                   If the flag is set spotfix (i.e. chkdsk /spotfix) will not work.

   /P:count        Zero every sector on the volume.  After that, the volume will be
                   overwritten ""count"" times using a different random number each time.
                   If ""count"" is zero, no additional overwrites are made after 
                   zeroing every sector.
                   This switchis ignored when /Q is specified.

   /Q              Perform a quick format. This switch overrides /P (zero out bytes).
                   Deletes the file table and the root directory of a previously formatted volume,
                   but does not perform a sector-by-sector scan for bad areas.
                   Use the /Q option to format only previously formatted volumes that are known
                   to be in good condition.

   /R:revision     UDF only: Force the format to a specific UDF version
                   (1.02, 1.50, 2.00, 2.01, 2.50).  default= 2.01

   /S:state        Support for short filenames (enable, disable)
                   Short names are disabled by default

   /T:tracks       The number of tracks per disk side.

   /V:label        The volume label.
                   If you omit this option, format will prompt for a volume label after the
                   formatting is complete. Use the syntax /V: to prevent the prompt.
                   If you use a single format command to format more than one disk, all of the
                   disks are given the same volume label.

   /X              Force the volume to dismount first if necessary.
                   All opened handles to the volume would no longer be valid."

                   options, format uses the volume type to determine the default format for the disk.

   /FS:file-system The type of file system (FAT, FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, UDF, ReFS).
   /A:size         Override the default allocation unit size. Also known as Cluster size.
                   Default settings are strongly recommended for general use. See below for allocation unit sizes.
                   NTFS compression is not supported for allocation unit sizes above 4096.

            [/deny User:Permission[...]]
               [/remove[:g|:d]] User[...]]

                        [/T] [/C] [/L] [/Q]

   Store ACLs for one or more directories matching name into aclfile for later use with /restore:
      ICACLS name /save aclfile [/T] [/C] [/L] [/Q]
    
   Restore ACLs to all files in directory:
      ICACLS directory [/substitute SidOld SidNew [...]]
          /restore aclfile [/C] [/L] [/Q]

   Change Owner:
      ICACLS name /setowner user [/T] [/C] [/L] [/Q]

   Find items with an ACL that mentions a specific SID:
      ICACLS name /findsid Sid [/T] [/C] [/L] [/Q]

   Find files whose ACL is not in canonical form or with a length inconsistent with the ACE count:
      ICACLS name /verify [/T] [/C] [/L] [/Q]
 
   Replace ACL with default inherited acls for all matching files:
      ICACLS name /reset [/T] [/C] [/L] [/Q]
   This is equivalent to “Replace all child permission entries with inheritable permission from this object” in the GUI.

Key
   name  The File(s) or folder(s) the permissions will apply to.

   /T  Traverse all subfolders to match files/directories. This will apply permission changes to
       all subfolders whether or not they are set to inherit permissions from the parent. On very large
       directory structures this may take some time as the command has to traverse the entire tree.
   
   /C  Continue on file errors (access denied) Error messages are still displayed.
  
   /L  Perform the operation on a symbolic link itself, not its target.

   /Q  Quiet - supress success messages.

   /grant :r user:permission
       Grant access rights, with :r, the permissions
       will replace any previouly granted explicit permissions (for the given user).
       Otherwise the permissions are added.

   /deny user:permission
       Explicitly deny the specified user access rights.
       This will also remove any explicit grant of the 
       same permissions to the same user.

   /remove[:[g|d]] User 
       Remove all occurrences of User from the acl. 
          :g remove all granted rights to that User/Sid.
          :d remove all denied rights to that User/Sid.

   /inheritance:e|d|r
          e - Enable inheritance
          d - Disable inheritance and copy the ACEs 
          r - Remove all inherited ACEs

   /setintegritylevel [(CI)(OI)]Level 
       Add an integrity ACE to all matching files. 
       level is one of L,M,H (Low Medium or High)

          Mandatory Label\Low Mandatory Level    = Low.
          Mandatory Label\Medium Mandatory Level = Medium/Standard.
          Mandatory Label\High Mandatory Level   = Elevated.

          If No mandatory label is displayed in the output, it is Medium by default. 

       A Directory Inheritance option for the integrity ACE can precede the level this
       is applied only to directories.

   user   A user account, Group or a SID

   /restore  Apply the acls stored in ACLfile to the files in directory

   permission is a permission mask and can be specified in one of two forms:
        a sequence of simple rights:
                D - Delete access
                F - Full access (Edit_Permissions+Create+Delete+Read+Write)
                N - No access
                M - Modify access (Create+Delete+Read+Write)
               RX - Read and eXecute access
                R - Read-only access
                W - Write-only access

How do I network location test (ad)?,NLTEST,Network Location Test (AD),"Syntax
      NLTEST [/server:servername] [operation[parameter]

Key
   /server: ServerName 
            Run nltest at a remote domain controller: ServerName.
            default = the local computer (a domain controller).

   /query   Report on the state of the secure channel the last time you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)

   /repl    Force synchronization with the primary domain controller (PDC).
            Nltest synchronizes only changes that are not yet replicated to the backup
            domain controller (BDC). NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sync    Force an immediate synchronization with the PDC of the entire SAM database.
            NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /pdc_repl Force the PDC to send a synchronization notification to all BDCs.
            NT 4.0 PDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_query: DomainName
             Report on the state of the secure channel the last time that you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)
            This parameter lists the name of the domain controller that you queried on the
            secure channel, also.

   /sc_reset:[ DomainName]
            Remove, and then rebuild, the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_verify:[ DomainName]
            Check the status of the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            If the secure channel does not work, this parameter removes the existing channel, and
            then builds a new one. You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_change_pwd:[ DomainName]
            Change the password for the trust account of a domain that you specify.
            If you run nltest on a domain controller, and an explicit trust relationship exists,
            then nltest resets the password for the interdomain trust account.
            Otherwise, nltest changes the computer account password for the domain that you specify.

   /dclist:[ DomainName]
            List all DCs in the domain.
            This command first queries Active Directory for a list of DCs.
            If this query is unsuccessful, nltest then uses the Browser service (if netbios is enabled).

   /dcname:[ DomainName]
            List the primary domain controller or the PDC emulator for DomainName.

   /dsgetdc:[ DomainName]
            Query the Domain Name System (DNS) server for a list of DCs and their
            IP addresses. This parameter also contacts each domain controller to check for connectivity.
            The following list shows the values that you can use to filter the list of DCs
            or specify alternate names types in the syntax.

            /PDC: Return only the PDC (Windows NT 4.0) or domain controllers designated as the PDC
                  emulator (Windows 2000 and later).
            /DS:  Return only those DCs that are Windows 2000 and later.
            /DSP: Return only Windows 2000 and later DCs. If the query finds no such server,
                  then return Windows NT 4.0 DCs.
            /GC:  Return only those DCs that are designated as global catalog servers.
            /KDC: Return only those DCs that are designated as Kerberos key distribution centers.
            /TIMESERV: Return only those DCs that are designated as time servers.
            /GTTIMESERV: Return only DCs designated as master time servers.
            /WS: /NetBIOS: Specifies computer names in the syntax as NetBIOS names.
            /DNS: Specify computer names in the syntax as fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
                  If you do not specify a return format, the DC can return either NetBIOS or DNS format.
            /IP:  Return only DCs that have IP addresses. i.e. return only TCP/IP DCs.
            /FORCE: Force the computer to run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in
                    the cache for the information.
            /Writable: Require that the returned DC be writable; All Windows 2000 DCs are writable
            /Avoidself: When called from a DC, specifies that the returned DC name should
                        not be the current computer. If the current computer is not a DC, this flag is ignored.
                        This flag can be used to obtain the name of another DC in the domain.
            /LDAPOnly: Specifies that the server returned is an LDAP server. The server returned is not
                       necessarily a DC. This flag can be used with the DS_GC_SERVER_REQUIRED flag
                       to return an LDAP server that also hosts a global catalog server.
                       If this flag is specified, the DS_PDC_REQUIRED, DS_TIMESERV_REQUIRED, 
                       DS_GOOD_TIMESERV_PREFERRED, DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_PREFERED,
                       DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_REQUIRED, and DS_KDC_REQUIRED flags are ignored.
            /Backg: If the DS_FORCE_REDISCOVERY flag is not specified, this function uses cached DC data.
                    If the cached data is more than 15 minutes old, the cache is refreshed by pinging
                    the DC. If this flag is specified, this refresh is avoided even if the cached data
                    is expired. This flag should be used if the DsGetDcName function is called periodically.
            /DS_6: Require that the returned DC be running Windows Server 2008 or later.
            /DS_8: Require that the returned domain controller be running Windows Server 2012 or later.
            /Try_Next_Closest_Site: When this flag is specified, DsGetDcName attempts to find a DC in
                                    the same site as the caller.
            /Ret_DNS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                      of DomainControllerInfo should be DNS names.
            /Ret_NETBIOS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                          of DomainControllerInfo should be flat names.

   /dnsgetdc: DomainName
            Query the DNS server for a list of domain controllers and their corresponding IP addresses.
            values that you can use to filter the list of DCs:
               /PDC: Return only those DCs that are PDCs (Windows NT 4.0) or designated as PDC emulators.
               /GC:  Return only those DCs that you designate as global catalogs.
               /KDC: Return only those DCs that you designate as Kerberos key distribution centers.
               /WRITABLE: Return only those DCs that can accept changes to the directory database.
                          This value returns all Active Directory DCs, but not Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.
               /LDAPONLY: Return servers that are running a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) application.
                          The servers can include LDAP servers that are not DCs.
               /FORCE:    Run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in cache.
               /SITE Sitename: Sort to list first the records that pertain to Sitename.
               /SITESPEC:      Filter the returned records to display only Sitename, used only with /SITE.

   /dsgetfti: DomainName[ /UpdateTDO]
            Return information about interforest trusts. You use this parameter only for a Windows Server 2008
            domain controller that is in the root of the forest. If no interforest trusts exist, this parameter
            returns an error. The /UpdateTDO value updates the locally stored information on the interforest trust.

   /dsgetsite
            Return the name of the site in which the DC resides.

   /dsgetsitecov
            Return the name of the site that the DC covers. A DC can cover a site
            that has no local DC of its own.

   /parentdomain
            Return the name of the parent domain of the server.

   /dsregdns
            Refreshe the registration of all DNS records that are specific to a DC that you specify.


   /dsderegdns: DnsHostName
            Deregisters DNS host records for the host that you specify in the DnsHostName parameter.
            values you can use to specify which records nltest deregisters:
               /DOM:  Specify a DNS domain name for the host to use when you search for records on the DNS server.
                      If you do not specify this value, nltest uses the DNS domain name as the suffix of the
                      DnsHostName parameter.
               /DSAGUID: Deletes Directory System Agent (DSA) records that are based on a GUID.
               DOMGUID: Deletes DNS records that are based on a globally unique identifier (GUID).

   /whowill: Domain/ User
            Find the DC that has the user account that you specify. Use this parameter to determine
            whether nltest has replicated the account information to other DCs.

   /finduser: User
            Find the directly-trusted domain that the user account User belongs to.
            Use this parameter to troubleshoot logon issues of older client Operating Systems.

   /transport_notify    Flushe the negative cache to force the discovery of a domain controller.
                        You can use this parameter for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers only.
                        This operation is done automatically when clients log on to Windows 2000 and
                        Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.
   /dbflag: HexadecimalFlags
            Set a new debug flag. For most purposes, use 0x2000FFFF as the value for HexadecimalFlags.
            The entry in the Windows Server 2003 registry for debug flags is
            HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DBFlag.

   /user: UserName
            Display many of the attributes that you maintain in the SAM account database for the user that
            you specify. You cannot use this parameter for user accounts that are stored in an AD database.

   /time: HexadecimalLSL HexadecimalMSL
            Convert Windows NT Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time to ASCII. HexadecimalLSL is a hex value for
            least significant longword. HexadecimalMSL is a hexa value for most significant longword.

   /logon_query
            Query the cumulative number of NTLM logon attempts at a console or over a network.

   /domain_trusts
            Returns a list of trusted domains. /Primary /Forest /Direct_Out /Direct_In /All_Trusts /v.
            values that you can use to filter the list of domains:
               /Primary: Return only the domain to which the computer account belongs.
               /Forest: Return only those domains that are in the same forest as the primary domain.
               /Direct_Out: Return only the domains that are explicitly trusted with the primary domain.
               /Direct_In: Return only the domains that explicitly trust the primary domain.
               /All_Trusts: Return all trusted domains.
               /v: Display verbose output, including any domain SIDs and GUIDs that are available.

   /dsquerydns
            Query for the status of the last update for all DNS records that are specific to a DC.

   /bdc_query: DomainName
            Query for a list of BDCs in DomainName, and then display their state of synchronization
            and replication status. You can use this parameter only for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers.

   /sim_sync: DomainName ServerName
            Simulate full synchronization replication. This is a useful parameter for test environments.

   /list_deltas: FileName
            Display the contents of the FileName change log file, which lists changes to the user account 
            database. Netlogon.chg is the default name for this log file, which resides only on Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.

   /cdigest: Message /domain: DomainName
            Display the current digest that the client uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest that is based on the previous password, also. Nltest uses
            the secure channel for logons between client computers and a domain controller, or for
            directory service replication between domain controllers. You can use this parameter in
            conjunction with the /sdigest parameter to check the synchronization of trust account passwords.

   /sdigest: <Message> /rid: RID_In_Hexadecimal
            Display the current digest that the server uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest for the previous password, also. If the digest from the
            server matches the digest from the client, then nltest synchronizes the passwords that it
            uses for the secure channel. If the digests do not match, then nltest might not have replicated
            the password change yet.

   /shutdown: Reason [Seconds]
            Remotely shut down the server that you specify in ServerName.
            Use a string to specify the reason for the shutdown in the Reason value.
            Use an integer value of Seconds before the shutdown will occur.
            (see InitiateSystemShutdown in the Platform SDK documentation.)

   /shutdown_abort

      NLTEST [/server:servername] [operation[parameter]

Key
   /server: ServerName 
            Run nltest at a remote domain controller: ServerName.
            default = the local computer (a domain controller).

   /query   Report on the state of the secure channel the last time you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)

   /repl    Force synchronization with the primary domain controller (PDC).
            Nltest synchronizes only changes that are not yet replicated to the backup
            domain controller (BDC). NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sync    Force an immediate synchronization with the PDC of the entire SAM database.
            NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /pdc_repl Force the PDC to send a synchronization notification to all BDCs.
            NT 4.0 PDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_query: DomainName
             Report on the state of the secure channel the last time that you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)
            This parameter lists the name of the domain controller that you queried on the
            secure channel, also.

   /sc_reset:[ DomainName]
            Remove, and then rebuild, the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_verify:[ DomainName]
            Check the status of the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            If the secure channel does not work, this parameter removes the existing channel, and
            then builds a new one. You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_change_pwd:[ DomainName]
            Change the password for the trust account of a domain that you specify.
            If you run nltest on a domain controller, and an explicit trust relationship exists,
            then nltest resets the password for the interdomain trust account.
            Otherwise, nltest changes the computer account password for the domain that you specify.

   /dclist:[ DomainName]
            List all DCs in the domain.
            This command first queries Active Directory for a list of DCs.
            If this query is unsuccessful, nltest then uses the Browser service (if netbios is enabled).

   /dcname:[ DomainName]
            List the primary domain controller or the PDC emulator for DomainName.

   /dsgetdc:[ DomainName]
            Query the Domain Name System (DNS) server for a list of DCs and their
            IP addresses. This parameter also contacts each domain controller to check for connectivity.
            The following list shows the values that you can use to filter the list of DCs
            or specify alternate names types in the syntax.

            /PDC: Return only the PDC (Windows NT 4.0) or domain controllers designated as the PDC
                  emulator (Windows 2000 and later).
            /DS:  Return only those DCs that are Windows 2000 and later.
            /DSP: Return only Windows 2000 and later DCs. If the query finds no such server,
                  then return Windows NT 4.0 DCs.
            /GC:  Return only those DCs that are designated as global catalog servers.
            /KDC: Return only those DCs that are designated as Kerberos key distribution centers.
            /TIMESERV: Return only those DCs that are designated as time servers.
            /GTTIMESERV: Return only DCs designated as master time servers.
            /WS: /NetBIOS: Specifies computer names in the syntax as NetBIOS names.
            /DNS: Specify computer names in the syntax as fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
                  If you do not specify a return format, the DC can return either NetBIOS or DNS format.
            /IP:  Return only DCs that have IP addresses. i.e. return only TCP/IP DCs.
            /FORCE: Force the computer to run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in
                    the cache for the information.
            /Writable: Require that the returned DC be writable; All Windows 2000 DCs are writable
            /Avoidself: When called from a DC, specifies that the returned DC name should
                        not be the current computer. If the current computer is not a DC, this flag is ignored.
                        This flag can be used to obtain the name of another DC in the domain.
            /LDAPOnly: Specifies that the server returned is an LDAP server. The server returned is not
                       necessarily a DC. This flag can be used with the DS_GC_SERVER_REQUIRED flag
                       to return an LDAP server that also hosts a global catalog server.
                       If this flag is specified, the DS_PDC_REQUIRED, DS_TIMESERV_REQUIRED, 
                       DS_GOOD_TIMESERV_PREFERRED, DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_PREFERED,
                       DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_REQUIRED, and DS_KDC_REQUIRED flags are ignored.
            /Backg: If the DS_FORCE_REDISCOVERY flag is not specified, this function uses cached DC data.
                    If the cached data is more than 15 minutes old, the cache is refreshed by pinging
                    the DC. If this flag is specified, this refresh is avoided even if the cached data
                    is expired. This flag should be used if the DsGetDcName function is called periodically.
            /DS_6: Require that the returned DC be running Windows Server 2008 or later.
            /DS_8: Require that the returned domain controller be running Windows Server 2012 or later.
            /Try_Next_Closest_Site: When this flag is specified, DsGetDcName attempts to find a DC in
                                    the same site as the caller.
            /Ret_DNS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                      of DomainControllerInfo should be DNS names.
            /Ret_NETBIOS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                          of DomainControllerInfo should be flat names.

   /dnsgetdc: DomainName
            Query the DNS server for a list of domain controllers and their corresponding IP addresses.
            values that you can use to filter the list of DCs:
               /PDC: Return only those DCs that are PDCs (Windows NT 4.0) or designated as PDC emulators.
               /GC:  Return only those DCs that you designate as global catalogs.
               /KDC: Return only those DCs that you designate as Kerberos key distribution centers.
               /WRITABLE: Return only those DCs that can accept changes to the directory database.
                          This value returns all Active Directory DCs, but not Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.
               /LDAPONLY: Return servers that are running a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) application.
                          The servers can include LDAP servers that are not DCs.
               /FORCE:    Run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in cache.
               /SITE Sitename: Sort to list first the records that pertain to Sitename.
               /SITESPEC:      Filter the returned records to display only Sitename, used only with /SITE.

   /dsgetfti: DomainName[ /UpdateTDO]
            Return information about interforest trusts. You use this parameter only for a Windows Server 2008
            domain controller that is in the root of the forest. If no interforest trusts exist, this parameter
            returns an error. The /UpdateTDO value updates the locally stored information on the interforest trust.

   /dsgetsite
            Return the name of the site in which the DC resides.

   /dsgetsitecov
            Return the name of the site that the DC covers. A DC can cover a site
            that has no local DC of its own.

            Deregisters DNS host records for the host that you specify in the DnsHostName parameter.
            values you can use to specify which records nltest deregisters:
               /DOM:  Specify a DNS domain name for the host to use when you search for records on the DNS server.
                      If you do not specify this value, nltest uses the DNS domain name as the suffix of the
                      DnsHostName parameter.
               /DSAGUID: Deletes Directory System Agent (DSA) records that are based on a GUID.
               DOMGUID: Deletes DNS records that are based on a globally unique identifier (GUID).

   /whowill: Domain/ User
            Find the DC that has the user account that you specify. Use this parameter to determine
            whether nltest has replicated the account information to other DCs.

   /finduser: User
            Find the directly-trusted domain that the user account User belongs to.
            Use this parameter to troubleshoot logon issues of older client Operating Systems.

   /transport_notify    Flushe the negative cache to force the discovery of a domain controller.
                        You can use this parameter for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers only.
                        This operation is done automatically when clients log on to Windows 2000 and
                        Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.
   /dbflag: HexadecimalFlags
            Set a new debug flag. For most purposes, use 0x2000FFFF as the value for HexadecimalFlags.
            The entry in the Windows Server 2003 registry for debug flags is
            HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DBFlag.

   /user: UserName
            Display many of the attributes that you maintain in the SAM account database for the user that
            you specify. You cannot use this parameter for user accounts that are stored in an AD database.

   /time: HexadecimalLSL HexadecimalMSL
            Convert Windows NT Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time to ASCII. HexadecimalLSL is a hex value for
            least significant longword. HexadecimalMSL is a hexa value for most significant longword.

   /logon_query
            Query the cumulative number of NTLM logon attempts at a console or over a network.

   /domain_trusts
            Returns a list of trusted domains. /Primary /Forest /Direct_Out /Direct_In /All_Trusts /v.
            values that you can use to filter the list of domains:
               /Primary: Return only the domain to which the computer account belongs.
               /Forest: Return only those domains that are in the same forest as the primary domain.
               /Direct_Out: Return only the domains that are explicitly trusted with the primary domain.
               /Direct_In: Return only the domains that explicitly trust the primary domain.
               /All_Trusts: Return all trusted domains.
               /v: Display verbose output, including any domain SIDs and GUIDs that are available.

   /dsquerydns
            Query for the status of the last update for all DNS records that are specific to a DC.

   /bdc_query: DomainName
            Query for a list of BDCs in DomainName, and then display their state of synchronization
            and replication status. You can use this parameter only for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers.

   /sim_sync: DomainName ServerName
            Simulate full synchronization replication. This is a useful parameter for test environments.

   /list_deltas: FileName
            Display the contents of the FileName change log file, which lists changes to the user account 
            database. Netlogon.chg is the default name for this log file, which resides only on Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.

   /cdigest: Message /domain: DomainName
            Display the current digest that the client uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest that is based on the previous password, also. Nltest uses
            the secure channel for logons between client computers and a domain controller, or for
            directory service replication between domain controllers. You can use this parameter in
            conjunction with the /sdigest parameter to check the synchronization of trust account passwords.

   /sdigest: <Message> /rid: RID_In_Hexadecimal
            Display the current digest that the server uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest for the previous password, also. If the digest from the
            server matches the digest from the client, then nltest synchronizes the passwords that it
            uses for the secure channel. If the digests do not match, then nltest might not have replicated
            the password change yet.

   /shutdown: Reason [Seconds]
            Remotely shut down the server that you specify in ServerName.
            Use a string to specify the reason for the shutdown in the Reason value.
            Use an integer value of Seconds before the shutdown will occur.
            (see InitiateSystemShutdown in the Platform SDK documentation.)

   /shutdown_abort
            Terminate a system shutdown.

   /sc_change_pwd:[ DomainName]
            Change the password for the trust account of a domain that you specify.
            If you run nltest on a domain controller, and an explicit trust relationship exists,
            then nltest resets the password for the interdomain trust account.
            Otherwise, nltest changes the computer account password for the domain that you specify.

   /dclist:[ DomainName]
            List all DCs in the domain.
            This command first queries Active Directory for a list of DCs.

            /Avoidself: When called from a DC, specifies that the returned DC name should
                        not be the current computer. If the current computer is not a DC, this flag is ignored.
                        This flag can be used to obtain the name of another DC in the domain.
            /LDAPOnly: Specifies that the server returned is an LDAP server. The server returned is not
                       necessarily a DC. This flag can be used with the DS_GC_SERVER_REQUIRED flag
                       to return an LDAP server that also hosts a global catalog server.
                       If this flag is specified, the DS_PDC_REQUIRED, DS_TIMESERV_REQUIRED, 
                       DS_GOOD_TIMESERV_PREFERRED, DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_PREFERED,

                    If the cached data is more than 15 minutes old, the cache is refreshed by pinging
                    the DC. If this flag is specified, this refresh is avoided even if the cached data
                    is expired. This flag should be used if the DsGetDcName function is called periodically.
            /DS_6: Require that the returned DC be running Windows Server 2008 or later.
            /DS_8: Require that the returned domain controller be running Windows Server 2012 or later.
            /Try_Next_Closest_Site: When this flag is specified, DsGetDcName attempts to find a DC in
                                    the same site as the caller.
            /Ret_DNS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                      of DomainControllerInfo should be DNS names.

               /LDAPONLY: Return servers that are running a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) application.
                          The servers can include LDAP servers that are not DCs.
               /FORCE:    Run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in cache.
               /SITE Sitename: Sort to list first the records that pertain to Sitename.
               /SITESPEC:      Filter the returned records to display only Sitename, used only with /SITE.

   /dsgetfti: DomainName[ /UpdateTDO]
            Return information about interforest trusts. You use this parameter only for a Windows Server 2008
            domain controller that is in the root of the forest. If no interforest trusts exist, this parameter
            returns an error. The /UpdateTDO value updates the locally stored information on the interforest trust.

   /dsgetsite
            Return the name of the site in which the DC resides.

   /dsgetsitecov

            Deregisters DNS host records for the host that you specify in the DnsHostName parameter.
            values you can use to specify which records nltest deregisters:
               /DOM:  Specify a DNS domain name for the host to use when you search for records on the DNS server.
                      If you do not specify this value, nltest uses the DNS domain name as the suffix of the
                      DnsHostName parameter.
               /DSAGUID: Deletes Directory System Agent (DSA) records that are based on a GUID.
               DOMGUID: Deletes DNS records that are based on a globally unique identifier (GUID).

   /whowill: Domain/ User
            Find the DC that has the user account that you specify. Use this parameter to determine
            whether nltest has replicated the account information to other DCs.

   /finduser: User
            Find the directly-trusted domain that the user account User belongs to.

   /transport_notify    Flushe the negative cache to force the discovery of a domain controller.
                        You can use this parameter for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers only.
                        This operation is done automatically when clients log on to Windows 2000 and
                        Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.
   /dbflag: HexadecimalFlags
            Set a new debug flag. For most purposes, use 0x2000FFFF as the value for HexadecimalFlags.
            The entry in the Windows Server 2003 registry for debug flags is
            HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DBFlag.

   /user: UserName
            Display many of the attributes that you maintain in the SAM account database for the user that
            you specify. You cannot use this parameter for user accounts that are stored in an AD database.

   /time: HexadecimalLSL HexadecimalMSL
            Convert Windows NT Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time to ASCII. HexadecimalLSL is a hex value for
            least significant longword. HexadecimalMSL is a hexa value for most significant longword.

   /logon_query
            Query the cumulative number of NTLM logon attempts at a console or over a network.

   /domain_trusts
            Returns a list of trusted domains. /Primary /Forest /Direct_Out /Direct_In /All_Trusts /v.
            values that you can use to filter the list of domains:
               /Primary: Return only the domain to which the computer account belongs.
               /Forest: Return only those domains that are in the same forest as the primary domain.
               /Direct_Out: Return only the domains that are explicitly trusted with the primary domain.

               /All_Trusts: Return all trusted domains.
               /v: Display verbose output, including any domain SIDs and GUIDs that are available.

   /dsquerydns
            Query for the status of the last update for all DNS records that are specific to a DC.

   /bdc_query: DomainName
            Query for a list of BDCs in DomainName, and then display their state of synchronization
            and replication status. You can use this parameter only for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers.

   /sim_sync: DomainName ServerName
            Simulate full synchronization replication. This is a useful parameter for test environments.

   /list_deltas: FileName
            Display the contents of the FileName change log file, which lists changes to the user account 
            database. Netlogon.chg is the default name for this log file, which resides only on Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.

   /cdigest: Message /domain: DomainName
            Display the current digest that the client uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest that is based on the previous password, also. Nltest uses
            the secure channel for logons between client computers and a domain controller, or for
            directory service replication between domain controllers. You can use this parameter in
            conjunction with the /sdigest parameter to check the synchronization of trust account passwords.

   /sdigest: <Message> /rid: RID_In_Hexadecimal
            Display the current digest that the server uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest for the previous password, also. If the digest from the
            server matches the digest from the client, then nltest synchronizes the passwords that it
            uses for the secure channel. If the digests do not match, then nltest might not have replicated
            the password change yet.

   /shutdown: Reason [Seconds]
            Remotely shut down the server that you specify in ServerName.
            Use a string to specify the reason for the shutdown in the Reason value.
            Use an integer value of Seconds before the shutdown will occur.
            (see InitiateSystemShutdown in the Platform SDK documentation.)

   /shutdown_abort
            Terminate a system shutdown.

            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)

   /repl    Force synchronization with the primary domain controller (PDC).
            Nltest synchronizes only changes that are not yet replicated to the backup
            domain controller (BDC). NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sync    Force an immediate synchronization with the PDC of the entire SAM database.
            NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

             Report on the state of the secure channel the last time that you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)
            This parameter lists the name of the domain controller that you queried on the
            secure channel, also.

   /sc_reset:[ DomainName]
            Remove, and then rebuild, the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_verify:[ DomainName]
            Check the status of the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            If the secure channel does not work, this parameter removes the existing channel, and
            then builds a new one. You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_change_pwd:[ DomainName]
            Change the password for the trust account of a domain that you specify.
            If you run nltest on a domain controller, and an explicit trust relationship exists,
            then nltest resets the password for the interdomain trust account.
            Otherwise, nltest changes the computer account password for the domain that you specify.

   /dclist:[ DomainName]
            List all DCs in the domain.
            This command first queries Active Directory for a list of DCs.
            If this query is unsuccessful, nltest then uses the Browser service (if netbios is enabled).

   /dcname:[ DomainName]
            List the primary domain controller or the PDC emulator for DomainName.

   /dsgetdc:[ DomainName]
            Query the Domain Name System (DNS) server for a list of DCs and their
            IP addresses. This parameter also contacts each domain controller to check for connectivity.
            The following list shows the values that you can use to filter the list of DCs
            or specify alternate names types in the syntax.

            /PDC: Return only the PDC (Windows NT 4.0) or domain controllers designated as the PDC
                  emulator (Windows 2000 and later).
            /DS:  Return only those DCs that are Windows 2000 and later.
            /DSP: Return only Windows 2000 and later DCs. If the query finds no such server,

            /WS: /NetBIOS: Specifies computer names in the syntax as NetBIOS names.
            /DNS: Specify computer names in the syntax as fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
                  If you do not specify a return format, the DC can return either NetBIOS or DNS format.
            /IP:  Return only DCs that have IP addresses. i.e. return only TCP/IP DCs.
            /FORCE: Force the computer to run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in
                    the cache for the information.
            /Writable: Require that the returned DC be writable; All Windows 2000 DCs are writable
            /Avoidself: When called from a DC, specifies that the returned DC name should
                        not be the current computer. If the current computer is not a DC, this flag is ignored.
                        This flag can be used to obtain the name of another DC in the domain.
            /LDAPOnly: Specifies that the server returned is an LDAP server. The server returned is not
                       necessarily a DC. This flag can be used with the DS_GC_SERVER_REQUIRED flag
                       to return an LDAP server that also hosts a global catalog server.
                       If this flag is specified, the DS_PDC_REQUIRED, DS_TIMESERV_REQUIRED, 
                       DS_GOOD_TIMESERV_PREFERRED, DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_PREFERED,
                       DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_REQUIRED, and DS_KDC_REQUIRED flags are ignored.
            /Backg: If the DS_FORCE_REDISCOVERY flag is not specified, this function uses cached DC data.
                    If the cached data is more than 15 minutes old, the cache is refreshed by pinging
                    the DC. If this flag is specified, this refresh is avoided even if the cached data
                    is expired. This flag should be used if the DsGetDcName function is called periodically.
            /DS_6: Require that the returned DC be running Windows Server 2008 or later.
            /DS_8: Require that the returned domain controller be running Windows Server 2012 or later.
            /Try_Next_Closest_Site: When this flag is specified, DsGetDcName attempts to find a DC in
                                    the same site as the caller.
            /Ret_DNS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                      of DomainControllerInfo should be DNS names.
            /Ret_NETBIOS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                          of DomainControllerInfo should be flat names.

   /dnsgetdc: DomainName
            Query the DNS server for a list of domain controllers and their corresponding IP addresses.
            values that you can use to filter the list of DCs:

               /WRITABLE: Return only those DCs that can accept changes to the directory database.
                          This value returns all Active Directory DCs, but not Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.
               /LDAPONLY: Return servers that are running a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) application.
                          The servers can include LDAP servers that are not DCs.
               /FORCE:    Run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in cache.
               /SITE Sitename: Sort to list first the records that pertain to Sitename.
               /SITESPEC:      Filter the returned records to display only Sitename, used only with /SITE.

   /dsgetfti: DomainName[ /UpdateTDO]
            Return information about interforest trusts. You use this parameter only for a Windows Server 2008
            domain controller that is in the root of the forest. If no interforest trusts exist, this parameter
            returns an error. The /UpdateTDO value updates the locally stored information on the interforest trust.

                      If you do not specify this value, nltest uses the DNS domain name as the suffix of the
                      DnsHostName parameter.
               /DSAGUID: Deletes Directory System Agent (DSA) records that are based on a GUID.
               DOMGUID: Deletes DNS records that are based on a globally unique identifier (GUID).

   /whowill: Domain/ User
            Find the DC that has the user account that you specify. Use this parameter to determine
            whether nltest has replicated the account information to other DCs.

   /finduser: User
            Find the directly-trusted domain that the user account User belongs to.
            Use this parameter to troubleshoot logon issues of older client Operating Systems.

   /transport_notify    Flushe the negative cache to force the discovery of a domain controller.
                        You can use this parameter for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers only.
                        This operation is done automatically when clients log on to Windows 2000 and
                        Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.
   /dbflag: HexadecimalFlags
            Set a new debug flag. For most purposes, use 0x2000FFFF as the value for HexadecimalFlags.
            The entry in the Windows Server 2003 registry for debug flags is
            HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DBFlag.

   /user: UserName
            Display many of the attributes that you maintain in the SAM account database for the user that
            you specify. You cannot use this parameter for user accounts that are stored in an AD database.

   /time: HexadecimalLSL HexadecimalMSL
            Convert Windows NT Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time to ASCII. HexadecimalLSL is a hex value for
            least significant longword. HexadecimalMSL is a hexa value for most significant longword.

   /logon_query
            Query the cumulative number of NTLM logon attempts at a console or over a network.

   /domain_trusts
            Returns a list of trusted domains. /Primary /Forest /Direct_Out /Direct_In /All_Trusts /v.
            values that you can use to filter the list of domains:

            Query for a list of BDCs in DomainName, and then display their state of synchronization
            and replication status. You can use this parameter only for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers.

   /sim_sync: DomainName ServerName
            Simulate full synchronization replication. This is a useful parameter for test environments.

   /list_deltas: FileName
            Display the contents of the FileName change log file, which lists changes to the user account

            Display the current digest that the client uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest that is based on the previous password, also. Nltest uses
            the secure channel for logons between client computers and a domain controller, or for
            directory service replication between domain controllers. You can use this parameter in
            conjunction with the /sdigest parameter to check the synchronization of trust account passwords.

   /sdigest: <Message> /rid: RID_In_Hexadecimal
            Display the current digest that the server uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest for the previous password, also. If the digest from the
            server matches the digest from the client, then nltest synchronizes the passwords that it
            uses for the secure channel. If the digests do not match, then nltest might not have replicated
            the password change yet.

   /shutdown: Reason [Seconds]
            Remotely shut down the server that you specify in ServerName.
            Use a string to specify the reason for the shutdown in the Reason value.
            Use an integer value of Seconds before the shutdown will occur.
            (see InitiateSystemShutdown in the Platform SDK documentation.)

   /shutdown_abort
            Terminate a system shutdown.

         A print queue with a higher priority receives all its
         jobs before any queue with a lower priority. 

   -i DefaultPriority 
            The default priority assigned to each print job. 

   {+ | -}shared 
            Is this printer is shared on the network. 

   {+ | -}direct 
            Is the document to be sent directly to the printer without being spooled. 

   {+ | -}published 
            Is this printer to be published in Active Directory.
            If you publish a printer, other users can search for it based on its location
            and capabilities, such as color printing and stapling.

   {+ | -}hidden 
             Reserved function.

   {+ | -}rawonly 
             Are only raw data print jobs to be spooled on this queue. 

   {+ | -}queued 
             Do not begin to print until after the last page of the document is spooled.
             The printing program is unavailable until the document has finished printing.
             This option ensures that the whole document is available to the printer.

   {+ | -}keepprintedjobs 
             Retain documents after they are printed.
             Allows a user to resubmit a document to the printer from the print queue. 

   {+ | -}workoffline 
             Allow sending print jobs when computer is not connected to the network. 

   {+ | -}enabledevq 
             Print jobs that do not match the printer setup (for example, PostScript files
             spooled to non-PostScript printers) should be held in the queue rather than 
             being printed. 

   {+ | -}docompletefirst 
             Allocate jobs to a printer as soon as thay are spooled.
             If this option is disabled, the spooler always sends higher priority
             jobs to their respective queues first.
             You should enable this option if you want to maximize printer efficiency
             at the cost of job priority.  

   {+ | -}enablebidi 
             Send bi-directional status information to the spooler.

 Exclude/Include

               /XO : Exclude Older - if destination file already exists and is the same date
                     or newer than the source, don’t overwrite it.
               /XC : Exclude Changed files.
               /XN : Exclude Newer files.
               /XL : Exclude ""Lonely"" files and dirs (present in source but not destination)
                     This will prevent any new files being added to the destination.
               /XX : Exclude ""eXtra"" files and dirs (present in destination but not source)
                     This will prevent any deletions from the destination. (this is the default)
                     Will also suppress listing extra destination files in the log.

  /XF file [file]… : Exclude Files matching given names/paths/wildcards.
  /XD dirs [dirs]… : Exclude Directories matching given names/paths.
                     XF and XD can be used in combination  e.g.
                     ROBOCOPY c:\source d:\dest /XF *.dmp ""pagefile.sys"" /XD ""c:\System Volume Information"" /S 

   /IA:[RASHCNETO] : Include files with any of the given Attributes.
   /XA:[RASHCNETO] : Exclude files with any of the given Attributes.

               /IM : Include modified MFT files. The MFT (Master File Table) contains file attributes, filenames and
                     security permissions. If the MFT timestamp is different then the destination file will be
                     overwritten even if all the attributes are the same. /IM is equivalent to /copy:DATS
                     By default robocopy ignores the file attributes and looks only at the file size and modified time.

               /IS : Include Same, overwrite files even if they are already the same.
               /IT : Include Tweaked files. If any file attribute is different the destination file is overwritten.

               /XJ : Exclude Junction points from source. (included by default).
              /XJD : Exclude junction points from source directories.
              /XJF : Exclude junction points from source files.

            /MAX:n : MAXimum file size - exclude files bigger than n bytes.
            /MIN:n : MINimum file size - exclude files smaller than n bytes.
         /MAXLAD:n : MAXimum Last Access Date - exclude files unused since n.
         /MINLAD:n : MINimum Last Access Date - exclude files used since n.
                     (If n < 1900 then n = n days, else n = YYYYMMDD date).

 Advanced options
            /BYTES : Print sizes as bytes.
            /DEBUG : Show debug volume information (undocumented)
              /ETA : Show Estimated Time of Arrival of copied files.
             /LFSM : Operate in ""low free space"" mode, enabling copy, pause and resume, see notes below.
      /LFSM:n[KMG] : /LFSM, specifying the floor size in [K:Kilo,M:Mega,G:Giga] bytes.
           /TIMFIX : FIX file TIMes on all files, even skipped files.
                /Z : Copy files in restartable mode (survive network glitch) use with caution as
                     this significantly reduces copy performance due to the extra logging.
               /ZB : Use restartable mode; if access denied use Backup mode. This option significantly
                     reduces copy performance because of checkpointing."

         /MINAGE:n : MINimum file AGE - exclude files newer than n days/date.
                     (If n < 1900 then n = no of days, else n = YYYYMMDD date).

              /FFT : Assume FAT File Times (2-second date/time granularity).
                     Use this when copying files to a Linux NAS or other non-windows file system.

              /256 : Turn off very long path (> 256 characters) support.

 Copy options

 /COPY:copyflag[s] : What to COPY for FILES (default is /COPY:DAT)
                       (copyflags : D=Data, A=Attributes, T=Timestamps,
                                    S=Security=NTFS ACLs, O=Owner info, U=aUditing info)

                /B : Copy files in Backup mode.
           /EFSRAW : Copy any encrypted files using EFS RAW mode.
                /L : List only - don’t copy, timestamp or delete any files.

           /MT[:n] : Multithreaded copying, n = no. of threads to use (1-128)
                     default = 8 threads, not compatible with /IPG and /EFSRAW
                     Redirecting output using /LOG is recommended for even better performance.

              /R:n : Number of Retries on failed copies - default is 1 million.
              /W:n : Wait time between retries - default is 30 seconds.

                     also using one of these options: /COPYALL  /COPY:O  /COPY:S  /COPY:U  /SEC

  Logging options

                /L : List only - don’t copy, timestamp or delete any files.
                     Comparisons with Destination_folder will only be performed if the folder exists.

             /NOSD : NO Source Directory is specified.
             /NODD : NO Destination Directory is specified.
                       The command-line and job file cannot contain conflicting Source/Destination paths.
                       In the .RCJ job file, Source/Destination paths can be given as /SD:path and /DD:path
                       /NOSD and /NODD can be used either on the command line or in the job file.
             /QUIT : QUIT after processing command line (to view parameters). 
               /IF : Include the following Files.

 Repeated Copy Options

            /MON:n : MONitor source; run again when more than n changes seen.
            /MOT:m : MOnitor source; run again in m minutes Time, if changed.
                     This will continue until you terminate the Robocopy process with Ctrl-C.
                     The Robocopy /MON process can also be started/stopped by setting the run hours, see below.
     /RH:hhmm-hhmm : Run Hours - e.g. /RH:1800-0200
                     If the robocopy command is launched outside the given hours it will pause until the next start time.
               /PF : Check run hours on a Per File (not per pass) basis.

 Exclude/Include

               /XO : Exclude Older - if destination file already exists and is the same date
                     or newer than the source, don’t overwrite it.
               /XC : Exclude Changed files.
               /XN : Exclude Newer files.
               /XL : Exclude ""Lonely"" files and dirs (present in source but not destination)
                     This will prevent any new files being added to the destination.
               /XX : Exclude ""eXtra"" files and dirs (present in destination but not source)
                     This will prevent any deletions from the destination. (this is the default)
                     Will also suppress listing extra destination files in the log.

  /XF file [file]… : Exclude Files matching given names/paths/wildcards.
  /XD dirs [dirs]… : Exclude Directories matching given names/paths.
                     XF and XD can be used in combination  e.g.
                     ROBOCOPY c:\source d:\dest /XF *.dmp ""pagefile.sys"" /XD ""c:\System Volume Information"" /S 

   /IA:[RASHCNETO] : Include files with any of the given Attributes.
   /XA:[RASHCNETO] : Exclude files with any of the given Attributes.

               /IM : Include modified MFT files. The MFT (Master File Table) contains file attributes, filenames and
                     security permissions. If the MFT timestamp is different then the destination file will be
                     overwritten even if all the attributes are the same. /IM is equivalent to /copy:DATS
                     By default robocopy ignores the file attributes and looks only at the file size and modified time.

               /IS : Include Same, overwrite files even if they are already the same.
               /IT : Include Tweaked files. If any file attribute is different the destination file is overwritten.

               /XJ : Exclude Junction points from source. (included by default).
              /XJD : Exclude junction points from source directories.
              /XJF : Exclude junction points from source files.

            /MAX:n : MAXimum file size - exclude files bigger than n bytes.
            /MIN:n : MINimum file size - exclude files smaller than n bytes.
         /MAXLAD:n : MAXimum Last Access Date - exclude files unused since n.
         /MINLAD:n : MINimum Last Access Date - exclude files used since n.
                     (If n < 1900 then n = n days, else n = YYYYMMDD date).

 Advanced options
            /BYTES : Print sizes as bytes.
            /DEBUG : Show debug volume information (undocumented)
              /ETA : Show Estimated Time of Arrival of copied files.
             /LFSM : Operate in ""low free space"" mode, enabling copy, pause and resume, see notes below.
      /LFSM:n[KMG] : /LFSM, specifying the floor size in [K:Kilo,M:Mega,G:Giga] bytes.
           /TIMFIX : FIX file TIMes on all files, even skipped files.
                /Z : Copy files in restartable mode (survive network glitch) use with caution as
                     this significantly reduces copy performance due to the extra logging.
               /ZB : Use restartable mode; if access denied use Backup mode. This option significantly
                     reduces copy performance because of checkpointing."

How do I sort input?,SORT,Sort input,"Syntax
      SORT [options] 

Options

   /+n   Sort the file ignoring the first one or more characters in each row.
         The default (/+1) will sort using all characters in each row.
          /+2 will start comparing at the second character, /+3 the third etc.
         Lines with fewer than n characters collate before other lines.

   /C[ASE_SENSITIVE]

         Case sensitive sort. (undocumented switch in Win7 and above)
         Dependent on the locale some characters will sort before A ('- !#) or after Z (~£¬Ξ)

  [drive:][pathname]

         The file to be sorted.
         If not specified, the standard input is sorted.
         Specifying an input file is faster than redirecting the same file as standard input.

   /L[OCALE] locale

         Override the system default locale with the specified locale.
         Only two locales are supported, the default and the ""C"" locale.
         The ""C"" locale yields the fastest collating sequence (sort order).

         By default sorting with the C locale is case insensitive, so will not consistently place
         'A' before or after 'a'.
         When both the C locale and /Case_Sensitive are specified, all capitals will sort before
         lower case, so Z before a.
         The C locale is not the same collation as LC_ALL=C in Unix.

   /M[EMORY] kilobytes

         The amount of main memory to use for the sort, in KiB.
         The best performance is usually achieved by not specifying a memory size.

         The memory size is always constrained to be a minimum of 160 KiB.
         If the memory size is specified the exact amount will be used for the sort,
         regardless of how much main memory is available.

         By default the sort will be done with one pass (no temporary file) if it fits in the
         default maximum memory size, otherwise the sort will be done in two passes
         (with the partially sorted data being stored in a temporary file) such that the
         amount of memory used for both the sort and merge passes are equal.  The default
         maximum memory size is 90% of available main memory if both the input and output are
         files, and 45% of main memory otherwise.

         SORT will only create a temporary file when required by limitations in available memory.

   /REC[ORD_MAXIMUM] characters 

         The maximum number of characters in a row or record
         (default 4096, maximum 65535)

   /R[EVERSE]  Reverse the sort order (Z to A, 9 to 0)

   /T[EMPORARY] [drive:][path]

         The path of the directory to hold SORT’s working storage, in case the data does not fit in RAM.
         The default is the system temporary directory %temp%

   /O[UTPUT] [drive:][pathname]

         The file where the sorted input is to be stored.
         If not specified, the data is written to standard output.
         Specifying an output file is faster than redirecting standard output to the same file.

   /U[NI_OUTPUT]
         Output in unicode. (undocumented switch in Win7 and above)

   /UNIQ[UE]
         Output only unique lines (undocumented switch in Windows 10 and above)"

Options
   -4    Use IPv4 addresses only.
   -6    Use IPv6 addresses only.

   -A    Enable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.
   -a    Disable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

   -B bind_interface
         Bind to the address of bind_interface before attempting to connect to the destination host.
         This is only useful on systems with more than one address.

   -b bind_address
         Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.
         Only useful on systems with more than one address.

   -C    Use data compression.

   -c cipher_spec
         Select the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

   -D [bind_address:]port
         Dynamic application-level port forwarding.
         This allocates a socket to listen to port on the local side.
         When a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel,
         and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

   -E log_file
         Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

   -e escape_char
         Set the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
         The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line. The escape character
         followed by a dot (.) closes the connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection;
         and followed by itself sends the escape character once.
         Setting the character to 'none' disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent. 

   -F configfile
         Specifies a per-user configuration file.
         The default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

   -f    Request ssh to go to background just before command execution.
         Useful if ssh is going to ask for a passwords, but the user wants it in the background.
         This implies -n. A recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is ssh -f host xterm.

         If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to 'yes', then a client started with -f 
         will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the background.

   -G    Causes ssh to print its configuration after evaluating Host and Match blocks and exit.

   -g    Allow remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.
         If used on a multiplexed connection, then this option must be specified on the master process. 

   -I pkcs11
         Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate with a PKCS#11 token
         providing keys for user authentication. 

   -i identity_file
         A file from which the identity key (private key) for public key authentication is read.

   -J [user@]host[:port]
         Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the pjump host[(/iam/jump-host)
         and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.

   -K    Enable GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server. 

   -k    Disable forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server. 

   -l login_name
         The user to log in as on the remote machine.

   -M    Place the ssh client into 'master mode for connection sharing.
         Multiple -M options places ssh into 'master' mode but with confirmation required using ssh-askpass(1)
         before each operation that changes the multiplexing state (e.g. opening a new session). 

   -m mac_spec
         A comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code) algorithms, specified in order of preference.

   -N    Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports. 

   -O ctl_cmd
         Control an active connection multiplexing master process.
         When the -O option is specified, the ctl_cmd argument is interpreted and passed to the master process.
         Valid commands are: 'check' (check that the master process is running), 'forward' (request forwardings
         without command execution), 'cancel' (cancel forwardings), 'exit' (request the master to exit),
         and 'stop' (request the master to stop accepting further multiplexing requests).

   -o option
         Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file. 

   -p port
         Port to connect to on the remote host.

   -Q query_option
         Query ssh for the algorithms supported for the specified version 2. The available features are:
         cipher (supported symmetric ciphers), cipher-auth (supported symmetric ciphers that support authenticated
         encryption), help (supported query terms for use with the -Q flag), mac (supported message integrity codes),
         kex (key exchange algorithms), key (key types), key-cert (certificate key types), key-plain (non-certificate
         key types), protocol-version (supported SSH protocol versions), and sig (supported signature algorithms). 

   -q    Quiet mode.

   -R [bind_address:]port:local_socket
   -R remote_socket:host:hostport
   -R remote_socket:local_socket
   -R [bind_address:]port
         Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded
         to the local side. 
         Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file. Privileged ports can be forwarded only when
         logging in as root on the remote machine. Specify IPv6 addresses be enclosing the address in square brackets.

   -S ctl_path
         Specifies the location of a control socket for connection sharing, or the string 'none' to disable connection sharing.
         Refer to the description of ControlPath and ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for details.

   -T    Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

   -t    Force pseudo-terminal allocation.
         This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful,
         e.g. when implementing menu services. Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.

   -V    Display the version number.

   -v    Verbose mode.

   -W host:port
         Request that standard input and output on the client be forwarded to host on port over the secure channel.
         Implies -N, -T, ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings, though these can be overridden in the configuration
         file or using -o command line options.

   -w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
         Request tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4) devices between the client (local_tun) and
         the server (remote_tun). The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword 'any', which uses the next
         available tunnel device. If remote_tun is not specified, it defaults to 'any'.
         See also the Tunnel and TunnelDevice directives in ssh_config(5).

         If the Tunnel directive is unset, it will be set to the default tunnel mode, which is 'point-to-point'.
         If a different Tunnel forwarding mode it desired, then it should be specified before -w.

   -X    Enable X11 forwarding. This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.
         X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
         host (for the user’s X authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded
         connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.

         For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.
         Please refer to the ssh -Y option and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for more information.

   -x    Disable X11 forwarding. 

   -Y    Enable trusted X11 forwarding. Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls. 
   -y    Send log information using the syslog(3) system module. By default this information is sent to stderr."

   -4    Use IPv4 addresses only.
   -6    Use IPv6 addresses only.

   -A    Enable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.
   -a    Disable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

   -B bind_interface
         Bind to the address of bind_interface before attempting to connect to the destination host.
         This is only useful on systems with more than one address.

   -b bind_address
         Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.
         Only useful on systems with more than one address.

   -C    Use data compression.

   -c cipher_spec
         Select the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

   -D [bind_address:]port
         Dynamic application-level port forwarding.
         This allocates a socket to listen to port on the local side.
         When a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel,
         and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

   -E log_file
         Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

   -e escape_char
         Set the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
         The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line. The escape character
         followed by a dot (.) closes the connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection;
         and followed by itself sends the escape character once.
         Setting the character to 'none' disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent. 

   -F configfile
         Specifies a per-user configuration file.
         The default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

   -f    Request ssh to go to background just before command execution.
         Useful if ssh is going to ask for a passwords, but the user wants it in the background.
         This implies -n. A recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is ssh -f host xterm.

         If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to 'yes', then a client started with -f 
         will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the background.

   -G    Causes ssh to print its configuration after evaluating Host and Match blocks and exit.

   -g    Allow remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.
         If used on a multiplexed connection, then this option must be specified on the master process. 

   -I pkcs11
         Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate with a PKCS#11 token
         providing keys for user authentication. 

   -i identity_file
         A file from which the identity key (private key) for public key authentication is read.

   -J [user@]host[:port]
         Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the pjump host[(/iam/jump-host)
         and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.

   -K    Enable GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server. 

   -k    Disable forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server. 

   -l login_name
         The user to log in as on the remote machine.

   -M    Place the ssh client into 'master mode for connection sharing.
         Multiple -M options places ssh into 'master' mode but with confirmation required using ssh-askpass(1)
         before each operation that changes the multiplexing state (e.g. opening a new session). 

   -m mac_spec
         A comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code) algorithms, specified in order of preference.

   -N    Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports. 

   -O ctl_cmd
         Control an active connection multiplexing master process.
         When the -O option is specified, the ctl_cmd argument is interpreted and passed to the master process.
         Valid commands are: 'check' (check that the master process is running), 'forward' (request forwardings
         without command execution), 'cancel' (cancel forwardings), 'exit' (request the master to exit),
         and 'stop' (request the master to stop accepting further multiplexing requests).

   -o option
         Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file. 

   -p port
         Port to connect to on the remote host.

   -Q query_option
         Query ssh for the algorithms supported for the specified version 2. The available features are:
         cipher (supported symmetric ciphers), cipher-auth (supported symmetric ciphers that support authenticated
         encryption), help (supported query terms for use with the -Q flag), mac (supported message integrity codes),
         kex (key exchange algorithms), key (key types), key-cert (certificate key types), key-plain (non-certificate
         key types), protocol-version (supported SSH protocol versions), and sig (supported signature algorithms). 

   -q    Quiet mode.
       
   -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
   -R [bind_address:]port:local_socket
   -R remote_socket:host:hostport
   -R remote_socket:local_socket
   -R [bind_address:]port
         Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded
         to the local side. 
         Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file. Privileged ports can be forwarded only when
         logging in as root on the remote machine. Specify IPv6 addresses be enclosing the address in square brackets.

   -S ctl_path
         Specifies the location of a control socket for connection sharing, or the string 'none' to disable connection sharing.
         Refer to the description of ControlPath and ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for details.

   -T    Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

   -t    Force pseudo-terminal allocation.
         This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful,
         e.g. when implementing menu services. Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.

   -V    Display the version number.

   -v    Verbose mode.

   -W host:port
         Request that standard input and output on the client be forwarded to host on port over the secure channel.
         Implies -N, -T, ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings, though these can be overridden in the configuration
         file or using -o command line options.

   -w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
         Request tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4) devices between the client (local_tun) and
         the server (remote_tun). The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword 'any', which uses the next
         available tunnel device. If remote_tun is not specified, it defaults to 'any'.
         See also the Tunnel and TunnelDevice directives in ssh_config(5).

         If the Tunnel directive is unset, it will be set to the default tunnel mode, which is 'point-to-point'.
         If a different Tunnel forwarding mode it desired, then it should be specified before -w.

   -X    Enable X11 forwarding. This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.
         X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
         host (for the user’s X authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded
         connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.

         For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.
         Please refer to the ssh -Y option and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for more information.

   -x    Disable X11 forwarding. 

   -Y    Enable trusted X11 forwarding. Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls. 
   -y    Send log information using the syslog(3) system module. By default this information is sent to stderr."

Key
  -addtarget     Storage location for backups. A disk, volume, or UNC path.
  -allCritical   Include all critical volumes in the backups. Use only with -backupTarget. Can be used with -include.
  -allowDeleteOldBackups  Overwrite any backups made before the computer was upgraded.
  -authsysvol    If used, performs an authoritative restore of SYSVOL (the System Volume shared directory).
  -autoReboot    Restart the system at the end of the system state recovery operation.
                 This parameter is valid only for a recovery to the original location.
                 We do not recommend you use this parameter if you need to perform steps after the recovery operation.

  -backupTarget  The storage location for this backup. Requires an HD drive letter, a volume GUID-based path or UNC path.

  -exclude       A comma-delimited list of items to exclude from the backup: files, folders, or volumes.
  -include       A comma-delimited list of items to include in the backup: multiple files, folders, or volumes.

  -excludeDisks  Valid only when specified with -recreateDisks and must be input as a comma-delimited list of
                 disk identifiers (as listed in the output of wbadmin get disks).
                 Excluded disks are not partitioned or formatted. This parameter helps preserve data on disks that
                 you do not want modified during the recovery operation.

  -hyperv        A comma-delimited list of components to be included in backup.
                 The identifier could be a component name or component GUID (with or without braces).

  -machine       The computer that you want backup details for. Use when backups of multiple computers are stored together.

  -nonRecurseExclude   Non-recursive, comma-delimited list of items to exclude from the backup.
  -nonRecurseInclude   Non-recursive, comma-delimited list of items to include in the backup. 
                       Use only with the -backupTarget parameter.

  -noRollForward Valid only when recovering applications. Allows for previous point-in-time recovery of an application
                 if the latest version from the backups is selected.
                 For other versions of the application that are not the latest, previous point-in-time recovery
                 is done as the default.

  -noVerify      Specifies that backups saved to removable media (such as a DVD) are not verified for errors.
  -noInheritAcl  Apply the access control list (ACL) permissions that correspond to the credentials provided by the
                  -user and -password parameters to the folder that contains the backup.

  -overwrite     Valid only when recovering files. If a file being recovered already exists:
                     Skip       - Skip the existing file and continue with recovery of the next file.
                     CreateCopy - Create a copy of the existing file so that the existing file is not modified.
                     Overwrite  - Overwrite the existing file with the file from the backup.

  -recoveryTarget  The location to restore to.
                   Use if this location is different than the location that was previously backed up.

  -recreateDisks Recover a disk configuration to the state that existed when the backup was created.
                 Warning: This parameter deletes all data on volumes that host Operating System components.
                 It might also delete data from data volumes.

  -recursive     Valid only when recovering files. Recover the files in the folders and all sub-folders.
                 By default, only files which reside directly in the specified folders are recovered.

  -restoreAllVolumes  Recover all volumes from the selected backup. If this parameter is not specified, only critical
                 volumes (volumes that contain the system state and Operating System components) are recovered.
                 This parameter is useful when you need to recover non-critical volumes during system recovery.

  -schedule      Times of day to create a backup, formatted as HH:MM and comma delimited.
  -showsummary   Report the summary of the last system state recovery (after the restart required to complete the operation).
                 This parameter cannot be accompanied by any other parameters.

  -skipBadClusterCheck   Skip checking the recovery disks for bad cluster information. If you are restoring to an alternate
                 server or hardware, we recommend that you do not use this parameter.
                 You can manually run chkdsk /b on your recovery disks at any time to check them for bad clusters, and then
                 update the file system information accordingly.
                 Warning: Until you run chkdsk the bad clusters reported on your recovered system may not be accurate.

  -systemState   Create a backup that includes the system state in addition to items specified with the -include.

  -user          The user with write permission to the backup storage destination.
                 A member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group on the computer being backed up.
  -password      The password for -user.

  -version       The version of the backup in MM/DD/YYYY-HH:MM format.
                 To view version information, type 'wbadmin get versions'.

  -vssFull       Perform a full back up using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).
                 All files are backed up, each file’s history is updated to reflect that it was backed up, and the logs
                 of previous backups may be truncated.
                 Do not use this parameter if you are using a product other than Windows Server Backup to back up
                 applications that are on the volumes included in the current backup. Doing so can potentially
                 break the incremental, differential, or other type of backups that the other backup product
                 is creating because the history that they rely on might be missing and they might perform
                 a full backup unnecessarily.

  -vssCopy       Perform a copy backup using VSS. All files are backed up but the history of the files being backup up
                 is not updated so you preserve the all the change information and log files.
                 This is the default value. A copy backup cannot be used for incremental or differential backups or restores.

  -addtarget     Storage location for backups. A disk, volume, or UNC path.
  -allCritical   Include all critical volumes in the backups. Use only with -backupTarget. Can be used with -include.
  -allowDeleteOldBackups  Overwrite any backups made before the computer was upgraded.
  -authsysvol    If used, performs an authoritative restore of SYSVOL (the System Volume shared directory).
  -autoReboot    Restart the system at the end of the system state recovery operation.
                 This parameter is valid only for a recovery to the original location.
                 We do not recommend you use this parameter if you need to perform steps after the recovery operation.

  -backupTarget  The storage location for this backup. Requires an HD drive letter, a volume GUID-based path or UNC path.

  -exclude       A comma-delimited list of items to exclude from the backup: files, folders, or volumes.
  -include       A comma-delimited list of items to include in the backup: multiple files, folders, or volumes.

  -excludeDisks  Valid only when specified with -recreateDisks and must be input as a comma-delimited list of
                 disk identifiers (as listed in the output of wbadmin get disks).
                 Excluded disks are not partitioned or formatted. This parameter helps preserve data on disks that
                 you do not want modified during the recovery operation.

  -hyperv        A comma-delimited list of components to be included in backup.
                 The identifier could be a component name or component GUID (with or without braces).

  -machine       The computer that you want backup details for. Use when backups of multiple computers are stored together.

  -nonRecurseExclude   Non-recursive, comma-delimited list of items to exclude from the backup.
  -nonRecurseInclude   Non-recursive, comma-delimited list of items to include in the backup. 
                       Use only with the -backupTarget parameter.

  -noRollForward Valid only when recovering applications. Allows for previous point-in-time recovery of an application
                 if the latest version from the backups is selected.
                 For other versions of the application that are not the latest, previous point-in-time recovery
                 is done as the default.

  -noVerify      Specifies that backups saved to removable media (such as a DVD) are not verified for errors.
  -noInheritAcl  Apply the access control list (ACL) permissions that correspond to the credentials provided by the
                  -user and -password parameters to the folder that contains the backup.

  -overwrite     Valid only when recovering files. If a file being recovered already exists:
                     Skip       - Skip the existing file and continue with recovery of the next file.
                     CreateCopy - Create a copy of the existing file so that the existing file is not modified.
                     Overwrite  - Overwrite the existing file with the file from the backup.

  -recoveryTarget  The location to restore to.
                   Use if this location is different than the location that was previously backed up.

  -recreateDisks Recover a disk configuration to the state that existed when the backup was created.
                 Warning: This parameter deletes all data on volumes that host Operating System components.
                 It might also delete data from data volumes.

  -recursive     Valid only when recovering files. Recover the files in the folders and all sub-folders.
                 By default, only files which reside directly in the specified folders are recovered.

  -restoreAllVolumes  Recover all volumes from the selected backup. If this parameter is not specified, only critical
                 volumes (volumes that contain the system state and Operating System components) are recovered.
                 This parameter is useful when you need to recover non-critical volumes during system recovery.

  -schedule      Times of day to create a backup, formatted as HH:MM and comma delimited.
  -showsummary   Report the summary of the last system state recovery (after the restart required to complete the operation).
                 This parameter cannot be accompanied by any other parameters.

  -skipBadClusterCheck   Skip checking the recovery disks for bad cluster information. If you are restoring to an alternate
                 server or hardware, we recommend that you do not use this parameter.
                 You can manually run chkdsk /b on your recovery disks at any time to check them for bad clusters, and then
                 update the file system information accordingly.
                 Warning: Until you run chkdsk the bad clusters reported on your recovered system may not be accurate.

  -systemState   Create a backup that includes the system state in addition to items specified with the -include.

  -user          The user with write permission to the backup storage destination.
                 A member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group on the computer being backed up.
  -password      The password for -user.

  -version       The version of the backup in MM/DD/YYYY-HH:MM format.
                 To view version information, type 'wbadmin get versions'.

  -vssFull       Perform a full back up using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).
                 All files are backed up, each file’s history is updated to reflect that it was backed up, and the logs
                 of previous backups may be truncated.
                 Do not use this parameter if you are using a product other than Windows Server Backup to back up
                 applications that are on the volumes included in the current backup. Doing so can potentially
                 break the incremental, differential, or other type of backups that the other backup product
                 is creating because the history that they rely on might be missing and they might perform
                 a full backup unnecessarily.

  -vssCopy       Perform a copy backup using VSS. All files are backed up but the history of the files being backup up
                 is not updated so you preserve the all the change information and log files.
                 This is the default value. A copy backup cannot be used for incremental or differential backups or restores.

How do I manage the wmi service/wmi repository?,WINMGMT,Manage the WMI service/WMI repository,"Syntax
      WINMGMT [/backup filename] 
      WINMGMT [/restore filename restore-mode] 
      WINMGMT [/resyncperf winmgmt service-process-id] 
      WINMGMT [/standalonehost level]
      WINMGMT [/sharedhost]
      WINMGMT [/verifyrepository path]
      WINMGMT [/salvagerepository] 
      WINMGMT [/resetrepository]

Options:

   /backup filename
      Back up the repository to the specified file name.
      The filename argument should contain the full path to the file location.
      This process requires a write lock on the repository so that write operations to the repository are suspended
      until the backup process is completed.
      If you do not specify a path for the file, it is saved to the %Windir%\System32 directory.

   /restore filename restore-mode
      Manually restore the WMI repository from the specified backup file.
      The filename argument should contain the full path to the backup file location.
      To perform the restore operation, WMI saves the existing repository to write back if the operation fails.
      Then the repository is restored from the backup file that is specified in the filename argument.
      If exclusive access to the repository cannot be achieved, existing clients are disconnected from WMI.

      The restore_mode flag must be a 1 (force disconnect users and restore)
      or 0 (default restore if no users connected).

   /resyncperf winmgmt-service-process-id
      Register the computer’s performance libraries with WMI. WMI PID is the process ID for the WMI service.
      Only needed if the performance monitor classes are not returning reliable results.

   /standalonehost [level]
      Move the Winmgmt service to a standalone Svchost process that has a fixed DCOM endpoint.
      The default endpoint is ""ncacn_ip_tcp.0.24158"". However, the endpoint may be changed by running Dcomcnfg.exe.
      For more information about setting up a fixed port for WMI, see Setting Up a Fixed Port for WMI.

      The level argument is the authentication level for the Svchost process. WMI normally runs as part of a shared service host and
      you cannot increase the authentication level for WMI alone.
      If level is not specified, the default is 4 (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT or WbemAuthenticationLevelPkt).

      You can run WMI more securely by increasing the authentication level to Packet Privacy
      (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY or WbemAuthenticationLevelPktPrivacy).
      The authentication levels for Visual Basic and scripting are described in WbemAuthenticationLevelEnum.
      For C++, see Setting the Default Process Security Level Using C++. For more information, see Maintaining WMI Security.

   /sharedhost
      Move the Winmgmt service into the shared Svchost process.

   /verifyrepository path
      Performs a consistency check on the WMI repository.

Options:

   /backup filename
      Back up the repository to the specified file name.
      The filename argument should contain the full path to the file location.
      This process requires a write lock on the repository so that write operations to the repository are suspended
      until the backup process is completed.
      If you do not specify a path for the file, it is saved to the %Windir%\System32 directory.

   /restore filename restore-mode
      Manually restore the WMI repository from the specified backup file.
      The filename argument should contain the full path to the backup file location.
      To perform the restore operation, WMI saves the existing repository to write back if the operation fails.
      Then the repository is restored from the backup file that is specified in the filename argument.
      If exclusive access to the repository cannot be achieved, existing clients are disconnected from WMI.

      The restore_mode flag must be a 1 (force disconnect users and restore)
      or 0 (default restore if no users connected).

   /resyncperf winmgmt-service-process-id
      Register the computer’s performance libraries with WMI. WMI PID is the process ID for the WMI service.
      Only needed if the performance monitor classes are not returning reliable results.

   /standalonehost [level]
      Move the Winmgmt service to a standalone Svchost process that has a fixed DCOM endpoint.
      The default endpoint is ""ncacn_ip_tcp.0.24158"". However, the endpoint may be changed by running Dcomcnfg.exe.
      For more information about setting up a fixed port for WMI, see Setting Up a Fixed Port for WMI.

      The level argument is the authentication level for the Svchost process. WMI normally runs as part of a shared service host and
      you cannot increase the authentication level for WMI alone.
      If level is not specified, the default is 4 (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT or WbemAuthenticationLevelPkt).

      You can run WMI more securely by increasing the authentication level to Packet Privacy
      (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY or WbemAuthenticationLevelPktPrivacy).
      The authentication levels for Visual Basic and scripting are described in WbemAuthenticationLevelEnum.
      For C++, see Setting the Default Process Security Level Using C++. For more information, see Maintaining WMI Security.

   /sharedhost
      Move the Winmgmt service into the shared Svchost process.

   /verifyrepository path
      Performs a consistency check on the WMI repository.
      When you add the /verifyrepository switch without the path argument, then the live repository currently used by WMI is verified.
      When you specify the path argument, you can verify any saved copy of the repository.

                             A single environment variable to be set when shell starts.
                             This allows changing default environment for the shell.
                             Multiple occurrences of this switch can be used.

   -noe[cho]                 Disable echo. This might be necessary to ensure that user’s answers
                             to remote prompts are not displayed locally. By default echo is ""on"".

   -nop[rofile]              Do not load the user’s profile. By default the server will attempt to load
                             the user profile. If the remote user is not a local administrator on the
                             target system then this option will be required.

   -comp[ression]            Turn on compression.  Older installations on remote machines may
                             not support compression so it is off by default.

   -[use]ssl                 Use an SSL connection when using a remote endpoint. Specifying this instead
                             of the transport ""https:"" will use the default WinRM default port.
