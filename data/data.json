version from the backups is selected for other versions of the application that are not the latest previous point-in-time recovery is done as the default -noverify specifies that backups saved to removable media such as a dvd are not verified for errors -noinheritacl apply the access control list acl permissions that correspond to the credentials provided by the -user and -password parameters to the folder that contains the backup -overwrite valid only when recovering files if a file being recovered already exists skip - skip the existing file and continue with recovery of the next file createcopy - create a copy of the existing file so that the existing file is not modified overwrite - overwrite the existing file with the file from the backup -recoverytarget the location to restore to use if this location is different than the location that was previously backed up -recreatedisks recover a disk configuration to the state that existed when the backup was created warning this

all sub-folders by default only files which reside directly in the specified folders are recovered -restoreallvolumes recover all volumes from the selected backup if this parameter is not specified only critical volumes volumes that contain the system state and operating system components are recovered this parameter is useful when you need to recover non-critical volumes during system recovery -schedule times of day to create a backup formatted as hh mm and comma delimited -showsummary report the summary of the last system state recovery after the restart required to complete the operation this parameter cannot be accompanied by any other parameters -skipbadclustercheck skip checking the recovery disks for bad cluster information if you are restoring to an alternate server or hardware we recommend that you do not use this parameter you can manually run chkdsk b on your recovery disks at any time to check them for bad clusters and then update the file system information accordingly warning until you run chkdsk the bad clusters reported on your recovered system may not be accurate -systemstate create a backup that includes the system state in addition to items specified with the

than windows server backup to back up applications that are on the volumes included in the current backup doing so can potentially break the incremental differential or other type of backups that the other backup product is creating because the history that they rely on might be missing and they might perform a full backup unnecessarily -vsscopy perform a copy backup using vss all files are backed
